patternbased measuresedit
earlier methods measuring convergence incorporate ratios phenotypic phylogenetic distance simulating evolution brownian motion model trait evolution along phylogeny5455 recent methods also quantify strength convergence56 drawback keep mind methods confuse longterm stasis convergence phenotypic similarities stasis occurs little evolutionary change among taxa53
