twenty years ephesus council chalcedon reaffirmed view jesus christ single person time declared person existed complete natures human divine opposed chalcedon concession nestorianism even conspiracy convert church nestorianism stealth result following decades gradually separated communion accepted council chalcedon formed body today called oriental orthodoxy
times chalcedonian christians referred oriental orthodox monophysites accusing following teachings eutyches argued jesus christ human divine monophysitism condemned heretical alongside nestorianism accuse church monophysite accuse falling opposite extreme nestorianism however oriental orthodox reject description inaccurate officially condemned teachings nestorius eutyches define miaphysite instead holding christ nature nature human divine10
