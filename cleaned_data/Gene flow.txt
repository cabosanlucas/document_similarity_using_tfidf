measuring gene flowedit
decrease population size leads increased divergence drift migration reduces divergence inbreeding gene flow measured using effective population size











displaystyle

migration rate generation using approximation based island model effect migration calculated population terms degree genetic differentiation








displaystyle

formula accounts proportion total molecular marker variation among populations averaged loci7 migrant generation inbreeding coefficient








displaystyle

equals however less migrant generation migration inbreeding coefficient rises rapidly resulting fixation complete divergence








displaystyle

common








displaystyle

means migration happening measures population structure range gene flow occurs migration deleterious effects inbreeding ameliorated1

barriers gene flowedit
allopatric speciationedit
gene flow blocked physical barriers results allopatric speciation geographical isolation allow populations species exchange genetic material physical barriers gene flow usually always natural include impassable mountain ranges oceans vast deserts cases artificial manmade barriers great wall china hindered gene flow native plant populations8 native plants ulmus pumila demonstrated lower prevalence genetic differentiation plants vitex negundo ziziphus jujuba heteropappus hispidus prunus armeniaca whose habitat located opposite side great wall china ulmus pumila grows8 ulmus pumila windpollination primary means propagation latterplants carry pollination insects8 samples species grow either side shown developed genetic differences little gene flow provide recombination gene pools




examples speciation affecting gene flow


sympatric speciationedit
barriers gene flow need always physical sympatric speciation happens species ancestral species arise along range often result reproductive barrier example palm species howea found lord howe island found substantially different flowering times correlated soil preference resulting reproductive barrier inhibiting gene flow9 species live environment show limited gene flow reproductive barriers fragmentation specialist pollinators limited hybridization hybridization yielding unfit hybrids cryptic species species humans cannot tell different without genetics moreover gene flow hybrid wild populations result loss genetic diversity genetic pollution assortative mating outbreeding

horizontal gene transferedit
main article horizontal gene transfer
horizontal gene transfer refers transfer genes organisms manner traditional reproduction either transformation direct uptake genetic material cell surroundings conjugation transfer genetic material bacterial cells direct contact transduction injection foreign bacteriophage virus host cell gtamediated transduction transfer viruslike element produced bacterium 1011
viruses transfer genes species12 bacteria incorporate genes dead bacteria exchange genes living bacteria exchange plasmids across species boundaries13 sequence comparisons suggest recent horizontal transfer many genes among diverse species including across boundaries phylogenetic domains thus determining phylogenetic history species done conclusively determining evolutionary trees single genes14
biologist gogarten suggests original metaphor tree longer fits data recent genome research biologists instead metaphor mosaic describe different histories combined individual genomes metaphor intertwined visualize rich exchange cooperative effects horizontal gene transfer15
using single genes phylogenetic markers difficult trace organismal phylogeny presence combining simple coalescence model cladogenesis rare events suggest single last common ancestor contained genes ancestral shared among three domains life contemporary molecule history traces back individual molecule cenancestor however molecular ancestors likely present different organisms different times16
genetic pollutionedit
main article genetic pollution
naturallyevolved regionspecific species threatened extinction17 genetic pollution potentially causing uncontrolled hybridization introgression genetic swamping processes lead homogenization replacement local genotypes result either numerical andor fitness advantage introduced plant animal18 nonnative species threaten native plants animals extinction hybridization introgression either purposeful introduction humans habitat modification bringing previously isolated species contact phenomena especially detrimental rare species coming contact abundant ones occur island mainland species interbreeding species cause swamping rarer species gene pool creating hybrids supplant native stock extent phenomenon always apparent outward appearance alone degree gene flow occurs course normal evolution hybridization without introgression threaten rare species existence1920 example mallard abundant species duck interbreeds readily wide range ducks poses threat integrity species21
