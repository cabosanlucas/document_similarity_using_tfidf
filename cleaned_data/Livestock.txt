fertilizer
manure spread fields increase crop yields important reason historically plant animal domestication intimately linked manure also used make plaster walls floors used fuel fires blood bone animals also used fertilizer
labor

land management
grazing livestock sometimes used control weeds undergrowth example areas prone wildfires goats sheep graze scrub removes combustible material reduces risk fires
conservation
