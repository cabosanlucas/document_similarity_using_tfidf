abdomen contains tubelike organs digestive tract well several solid organs hollow abdominal organs include stomach small intestine colon attached appendix organs liver attached gallbladder pancreas function close association digestive tract communicate ducts spleen kidneys adrenal glands also within abdomen along many blood vessels including aorta inferior vena cava anatomists consider urinary bladder uterus fallopian tubes ovaries either abdominal organs pelvic organs finally abdomen contains extensive membrane called peritoneum fold peritoneum completely cover certain organs whereas cover side organs usually closer abdominal wall anatomists call latter type organs retroperitoneal

three layers abdominal wall outside inside external oblique internal oblique transverse abdominal5 first three layers extend vertebral column lower ribs iliac crest pubis fibers merge towards midline surround rectus abdominis sheath joining opposite side linea alba strength gained crisscrossing fibers external oblique downward forward internal oblique upward forward transverse abdominal horizontally forward5
transverse abdominal muscle flat triangular fibers running horizontally lies internal oblique underlying transverse fascia originates pouparts ligament inner ilium lumbar fascia inner surface cartilages lower ribs inserts linea alba behind rectus abdominis
rectus abdominis muscles long flat muscle crossed three fibrous bands called tendinous intersections rectus abdominis enclosed thick sheath formed described fibers three muscles lateral abdominal wall originate pubis bone abdomen either side linea alba insert cartilages fifth sixth seventh ribs region groin inguinal canal passage layers testes drop wall fibrous cord uterus female runs also weakness form cause inguinal hernias5

abdominal organs anatomy


functionally human abdomen alimentary tract placed absorption digestion food occurs alimentary tract abdomen consists lower esophagus stomach duodenum jejunum ileum cecum appendix ascending transverse descending colons sigmoid colon rectum vital organs inside abdomen include liver kidneys pancreas spleen
abdominal wall split posterior back lateral sides anterior front walls
movement breathing functionsedit
abdominal muscles different important functions assist breathing process accessory muscles respiration moreover muscles serve protection inner organs furthermore together back muscles provide postural support important defining form glottis closed thorax pelvis fixed integral cough urination defecation childbirth vomit singing functions5 pelvis fixed initiate movement trunk forward motion also prevent hyperextension thorax fixed pull pelvis finally bend vertebral column sideways assist trunks rotation5
postureedit
transverse abdominus muscle deepest muscle therefore cannot touched outside greatly affect body posture internal obliques also deep also affect body posture involved rotation lateral flexion spine used bend support spine front external obliques superficial also involved rotation lateral flexion spine also stabilize spine upright rectus abdominus muscle superficial abdominal muscle tendonous sheath extending external obliques cover rectus abdominus rectus abdominus muscle people develop 6pack look although really pack vertical sections side bottom sections pubic bone usually visible hence pack rectus abdominals function bend ones back forward flexion main work abdominal muscles bend spine forward contracting coencentrically6
society cultureedit
also midriff navel popular culture
social cultural perceptions outward appearance abdomen varying significance around world depending type society excess weight perceived indicator wealth prestige excess food sign poor health lack exercise many cultures bare abdomens distinctly sexualized perceived similarly breast cleavage
exerciseedit
main article abdominal exercise
element support spine contribute good posture important properly exercise abdominal muscles together back muscles weak overly tight suffer painful spasms well injuries properly exercised abdominal muscles contribute improve posture balance reduce likelihood back pain episodes reduce severity back pain protect injury responding efficiently stresses help avoid back surgeries help healing back problem spine surgery also strengthened abdominal muscles provide flexibility well abdominal muscles worked practicing disciplines general body strength pilates yoga jogging among others also specific routines target muscles
clinical significanceedit
abdominal obesity condition abdominal visceral built excessively abdominal organs associated higher risk heart disease asthma type diabetes
abdominal trauma injury abdomen involve damage abdominal organs associated risk severe blood loss infection7 injury lower chest cause injuries spleen liver8
scaphoid abdomen abdomen sucked inwards9 newborn represent diaphragmatic hernia10 general indicative malnutrition11
diseaseedit
many gastrointestinal diseases affect abdominal organs include stomach disease liver disease pancreatic disease gallbladder bile duct disease intestinal diseases include enteritis coeliac disease diverticulitis
examinationedit
different medical procedures used examine organs gastrointestinal tract include endoscopy colonoscopy sigmoidoscopy enteroscopy oesophagogastroduodenoscopy virtual colonoscopy also number medical imaging techniques used surface landmarks important examination abdomen
