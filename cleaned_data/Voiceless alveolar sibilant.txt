manner articulation sibilant fricative means generally produced channeling flow along groove back tongue place articulation point focused sharp edge nearly clenched teeth causing highfrequency turbulence
least three specific variants

dentalized laminal alveolar commonly called dental means articulated tongue blade close upper front teeth tongue resting behind lower front teeth hissing effect variety strong7
nonretracted alveolar means articulated either blade tongue alveolar ridge termed respectively apical laminal according ladefoged maddieson 1996 half english speakers nonretracted apical articulation
retracted alveolar means articulated either blade tongue slightly behind alveolar ridge termed respectively apical laminal acoustically close laminal lesser extent


phonation voiceless means produced without vibrations vocal cords languages vocal cords actively separated always voiceless others cords take voicing adjacent sounds
oral consonant means allowed escape mouth
central consonant means produced directing airstream along center tongue rather sides
airstream mechanism pulmonic means articulated pushing solely lungs diaphragm sounds
