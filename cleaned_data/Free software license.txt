historyedit
also history free opensource software
1980sedit
early times software sharing software source code common certain communities instance academic institutions commission technological uses copyrighted works contu decided 1974 computer programs extent embody authors original creation proper subject matter copyright45 software considered copyrightable therefore software licenses attached shared public domain software contu decision plus court decisions apple franklin 1983 object code clarified copyright gave computer programs copyright status literary works started licensing software
free software licenses late 1980s generally informal notices written developers early licenses permissible kind
1980sedit
mid1980s project produced copyleft free software licenses software packages early license emacs copying permission notice used emacs 19856 subsequent revisions 1986 1987 1988 taking name emacs general public license7 likewise similar general public license applied compiler collection initially published 198789 original license also first free software licenses dating 1988 1989 version general public license published version released 1991 went become widely used free software license101112
1990s 2000sedit
starting mid1990s mid2000s open source movement pushed focused free software idea forward wider public business perception13 dotcom bubble time netscape communications step release webbrowser foss license 19981415 inspired many companies adapt foss ecosystem16 trend companies projects mozilla apache foundation also list wrote foss licenses adapted existing licenses license proliferation later recognized problem free open source ecosystem increased complexity license compatibility considerations17 creation licenses slowed later license proliferation impact considered ongoing serious challenge free open source ecosystem
free software licenses version tested court first germany 2004 later german case judge explicitly discuss validity gpls clauses accepted adhered agreed upon parties defendant would notwithstanding lack necessary rights copy distribute make software netfilteriptables publicly available defendant comply cease software18 case mysql progress settled verdict arrived initial hearing judge saris reason would enforceable19
around 2004 lawyer lawrence rosen argued essay public domain isnt license software could truly waived public domain cant interpreted permissive foss license20 position faced opposition daniel bernstein others21 2012 dispute finally resolved rosen accepted open source license admitting contrary previous claims copyright waived away backed ninth circuit decisions22
2007 years draft discussion gplv3 major update gplv2 released release controversial23 significant extended scope license made incompatible gplv224 several major foss projects linux kernel2526 mysql27 busybox2829 blender30 media player31 decided adopting gplv3 hand 2009 years release gplv3 google opensource programs office manager chris dibona reported number opensource projects licensed software moved gplv3 gplv2 counting projects hosted google code32
2010sedit
2011 four years release gplv3 opensource licensed projects gplv3 still gplv2 according black duck software data2633 following 2011 group analyst matthew aslett argued blog post copyleft licenses went decline permissive licenses increased based statistics black duck software3435
2015 according black duck software36 github statistics37 permissive license dethroned gplv2 popular free software license second place permissive apache license follows already third place june 2016 analysis fedora projects packages revealed used licenses lgpl38
definitionsedit
osiapproved open source licensesedit
main article opensource license
group open source initiative defines maintains list approved open source licenses agrees widely used free software licenses differ fsfs list approves open source definition rather free software definition considers free software permissive license group reference implementation free software licensecitation neededclarification needed thus requirements approving licenses different
fsfapproved free software licensesedit
free software foundation group maintains free software definition maintains nonexhaustive list free software licences39
free software foundation prefers copyleft sharealike free software licensing rather permissive free software licensing purposes list distinguishes free software licenses compatible incompatible fsfs copyleft general public license
conditions free software licensesedit
exists ongoing debate within free software community regarding fine line restrictions applied still called freecitation needed
public domain software software public domain like license restriction freecitation needed examples public domainlike licenses instance wtfpl license permissive licenses might carry small obligations like attribution author allow practically code cases certain licenses namely copyleft licenses include intentionally stronger restrictions especially distributiondistributor order force derived projects guarantee specific rights cant taken away
copyleftedit
main article copyleft
free software sharealike licenses written richard stallman mid1980s pioneered concept known copyleft ensuing copyleft provisions stated modified versions free software distributed must distributed terms original software hence referred share share alike quid results software open source well since copyleft ensures later generations software grant freedom modify code free software noncopyleft licenses ensure later generations software remain free
developers code product must make source code available anyone share sell object code case source code must also contain changes developers made code used shared sold code required made available changes remain private permits developers organizations modify code private purposes code project sold otherwise shared without required make changes available public
supporters claim mandating derivative works remain fosters growth free software requires equal participation users opponents claim40 license guarantee future software availability disadvantages outweigh41 advantages also argue restricting distribution makes license less free whereas proponents would argue preserving freedom distribution would make less free example noncopyleft license grant author freedom modified versions work publicly published whereas copyleft license grant freedom
patent retaliationedit
information patent retaliation
1990s free software licenses began including clauses patent retaliation order protect software patent litigation cases problem previously existed threat reasons writing version 200642 recent years term coined tivoization describes process hardware restrictions used prevent users running modified versions software hardware tivo device example viewed turn free software effectively nonfree chosen prohibit gplv343 newly written free software licenses since late 1990s include form patent retaliation clauses measures stipulate ones rights license redistribution terminated attempts enforce patents relating licensed software certain circumstances example apple public source license terminate users rights said user embarks litigation proceedings patent litigation patent retaliation emerged response proliferation abuse software patents
hardware restrictionsedit
main article hardware restrictions
version includes specific language prohibiting additional restrictions enforced hardware restrictions digital rights management practice calls tivoization tivo used gpl’d software devices disallowed user modification software
attribution disclaimers noticesedit
majority free software licenses require modified software claim unmodified licenses also require copyright holders credited example version requires interactive programs print warranty license information notices removed modified versions intended distribution
practical problems licensesedit
license compatibilityedit




license compatibility common foss software licenses according david wheeler 2007 vector arrows denote directional compatibility therefore better compatibility left side permissive licenses right side copyleft licenses44


main article license compatibility
licenses software packages containing contradictory requirements render impossible combine source code packages order create software packages45 license compatibility copyleft license another license often oneway compatibility46 oneway compatibility characteristic instanced criticized apache foundation provides permissive apache license doesnt characteristic47 noncopyleft licenses foss permissive licenses less complicated license interaction normally exhibit better license compatibility4849 example license says modified versions must mention developers advertising materials another license says modified versions cannot contain additional attribution requirements someone combined software package uses license software package uses would impossible distribute combination contradictory requirements cannot fulfilled simultaneously thus packages would licenseincompatible comes copyleft software licenses inherently compatible copyleft licenses even gplv2 compatible gplv32450
purpose useedit
restrictions software restrictions generally unacceptable according debian bsdbased distributions examples include prohibiting software used nonprivate applications military purposes comparison benchmarking good useclarification needed ethically questionable means51 commercial organisations52
definition conflictsedit
several defining organizations groups publish definitions guidelines foss licenses notably debian project bsds sometimes conflicting opinions interpretations
permissive versus copyleft opinionsedit
many users developers bsdbased operating systems different position licensing main difference belief copyleft licenses particularly general public license undesirably complicated andor restrictive53 requires derivative work also released according license essentially licenses requirement acknowledge original authors poses restrictions source code used
result code used proprietary software acknowledges authors instance microsoft windows macos proprietary stacks derived bsdlicensed software54 extreme cases relicensing possibilities permissive licenses might prevent open source ecosystem instance mathworks fileexchange repository offers license user contributions prevents additional terms usage beside proprietary matlab software instance foss octave software555657
positive side bsdlike permissive licenses limited restrictions typically attribution also excellent license compatibility even copyleft licenses4849
supporters license argue free grants right anything source code provided attribution preserved example users might incorporate bsdlicensed code proprietary products approach code used common widely used proprietary software response proponents point code becomes proprietary users lack freedoms define free software58 result consider license less free freedom lack restriction since license restricts right developers changes recontributed communitydubious discuss neither free sense lacking restrictions
code licensed permissive free software licence license incorporated copylefted instance gpld projects code thus gplcompatible need secure consent original authors contrast code cannot relicensed license without securing consent copyright holders thus licenses compatible unless consent obtained combination whole must distributed terms permissive license
existing free software bsdlicensed projects tend avoid including software licensed core operating system base system except last resort alternatives nonexistent vastly less capable example starting freebsd replaced clangllvm compiler perhaps primarily reasoncitation needed openbsd project acted remove gpllicensed tools favor bsdlicensed alternatives newly written adapted older code59
debianedit
debian project uses criteria laid debian free software guidelines dfsg notable cases debian free software foundation disagree artistic license free documentation license gfdl debian accepts original artistic license free software license disagrees little impact however since artistic license almost always used duallicense setup along general public license
controversial borderline casesedit
vast majority free software uses undisputed free software licenses however many debates whether certain licenses qualify definition
examples licenses provoked debate series apple public source license accepted open source initiative free software foundation debian realnetworks public source license accepted open source initiative free software foundation debian
also recommended free documentation license60 incompatible gpl61 considered nonfree debian project around 200662 nathanael nerode63 bruce perens64 argues documentation qualitatively different software subject different requirements debian accepted later resolution complied debian free software guidelines controversial invariant section removed considers still free trouble65 notwithstanding documentation includes invariant sections similarly floss manuals foundation organization devoted creating manuals free software decided eschew gfdl favor texts 2007 citing incompatibility difficulties implementing gfdl fact gfdl allow easy duplication modification especially digital documentation66
sluc software license published spain december 2006 allow military writers license maintain free software free software foundation says free infringes socalled zero freedom freedom software purpose67
market shareedit
historically widely used foss license gplv2 2015 according black duck software36 permissive license dethroned gplv2 second place permissive apache license follows third place study 2012 used publicly available data criticized black duck software publishing methodology used collecting statistics68 daniel german professor department computer science university victoria canada presented talk 2013 methodological challenges determining widely used free software licenses showed could replicate result black duck software69
github study 2015 statistical data found license prominent foss license platform37
