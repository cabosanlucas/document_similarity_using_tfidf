industrial plantations established produce high volume wood short period time plantations grown state forestry authorities example forestry commission britain andor paper wood industries private landowners weyerhaeuser rayonier sierra pacific industries united states asia pulp paper indonesia christmas trees often grown plantations well southern southeastern asia teak plantations recently replaced natural forest
industrial plantations actively managed commercial production forest products industrial plantations usually largescale individual blocks usually evenaged often consist species species exotic indigenous plants used plantation often genetically altered desired traits growth resistance pests diseases general specific traits example case timber species volumic wood production stem straightness forest genetic resources basis genetic alteration selected individuals grown seed orchards good source seeds develop adequate planting material

growth cycleedit

first year ground prepared usually combination burning herbicide spraying andor cultivation saplings planted human crew machine saplings usually obtained bulk industrial nurseries specialize selective breeding order produce fast growing disease pestresistant strains
first years canopy closes saplings looked dusted sprayed fertilizers pesticides established
canopy closes tree crowns touching plantation becoming dense crowded tree growth slowing competition stage termed pole stage competition becomes intense pine trees live crown less third trees total height time thin section several methods thinning topography permits popular rowthinning every third fourth fifth trees removed usually harvester many trees removed leaving regular clear lanes section remaining trees room expand removed trees delimbed forwarded forest road loaded onto trucks sent mill typical pole stage plantation tree 7–30 diameter breast height trees sometimes suitable timber used pulp paper particleboard chips oriented strand board
trees grow become dense crowded thinning process repeated depending growth rate species trees large enough timber milling used pulp chips
around year 1060 plantation mature economic terms falling back side growth curve passing point maximum wood growth hectare year ready final harvest remaining trees felled delimbed taken processed
ground cleared cycle repeated

plantation trees pines eucalyptus high risk fire damage leaf oils resins flammable point tree explosive conditionscitation needed conversely afflicted plantation cases cleared pest species cheaply prescribed burn kills lesser plants significantly harm mature trees
natural forest lossedit
many forestry experts claim establishment plantations reduce eliminate need exploit natural forest wood production principle true high productivity plantations less land needed many point example zealand forest area provides supply industrial round wood estimated worlds demand fiber could world forest sedjo botkin 1997 however practice plantations replacing natural forest example indonesia according natural closed forest lost tropics land converted plantations remaining loss land converted agriculture uses worldwide estimated plantations tropical countries established closed canopy natural forest
kyoto protocol proposals encouraging plantations reduce carbon dioxide levels though idea challenged groups grounds sequestered eventually released harvest

contrast naturally regenerated forest plantations typically grown evenaged monocultures primarily timber production

plantations usually near total monocultures species tree planted across given area whereas natural forest would contain diverse range tree species
plantations include tree species would naturally occur area include unconventional types hybrids genetically modified trees used sometime future2 since primary interest plantations produce wood pulp types trees found plantations bestsuited industrial applications example pine spruce eucalyptus widely planted beyond natural range fast growth rate tolerance rich degraded agricultural land potential produce large volumes material industrial
plantations always young forests ecological terms typically trees grown plantations harvested years rarely years means forests produced plantations contain type growth soil wildlife typical oldgrowth natural forest ecosystems conspicuous absence decaying dead wood crucial component natural forest ecosystems

1970s brazil began establish highyield intensively managed short rotation plantations types plantations sometimes called fastwood plantations fiber farms often managed shortrotation basis little years becoming widespread south america asia areas environmental social impacts type plantation caused become controversial indonesia example large multinational pulp companies harvested large areas natural forest without regard regeneration 1980 2000 million hectares pulpwood plantations indonesia established formerly natural forest land
replacement natural forest tree plantations also caused social problems countries notably indonesia conversions natural forest made little regard rights local people plantations established purely production fiber provide much narrower range services original natural forest local people india sought limit damage limiting amount land owned entity result smaller plantations owned local farmers sell wood larger companies large environmental organizations critical highyield plantations running antiplantation campaign notably rainforest action network greenpeace
farm homeedit
farm home plantations typically established production timber fire wood home sometimes sale management less intensive industrial plantations time type plantation become difficult distinguish naturally regenerated forest
teak bamboo plantations india given good results alternative crop solution farmers central india conventional farming popular rising input costs farming many farmers done teak bamboo plantations require little water first years teak bamboo legal protection theft bamboo planted gives output years till flowering occurs teak requires years grow full maturity fetch returns
established watershed soil protection established erosion control landslide stabilization windbreaks plantations established foster native species promote forest regeneration degraded lands tool environmental restoration
ecological impactedit
probably single important factor plantation local environment site plantation established natural forest cleared planted forest reduction biodiversity loss habitat likely result cases establishment involve draining wetlands replace mixed hardwoods formerly predominated pine species plantation established abandoned agricultural land highly degraded land result increase habitat biodiversity planted forest profitably established lands support agriculture suffer lack natural regeneration
tree species used plantation also important factor nonnative varieties species grown native fauna adapted exploit biodiversity loss occurs however even nonnative tree species serve corridors wildlife buffer native forest reducing edge effect
plantation established managed becomes important environmental factor single important factor management rotation period plantations harvested longer rotation periods years provide similar benefits naturally regenerated forest managed wood production similar rotation especially true native species used case exotic species habitat improved significantly impact mitigated measures leaving blocks native species plantation retaining corridors natural forest brazil similar measures required government regulation
