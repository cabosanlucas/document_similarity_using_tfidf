gastrointestinal tract digestive tract digestional tract tract alimentary canal organ system within humans animals takes food digests extract absorb energy nutrients expels remaining waste feces mouth oesophagus stomach intestines part gastrointestinal tract gastrointestinal adjective meaning pertaining stomach intestines tract collection related anatomic structures series connected body organs
bilaterians gastrointestinal tract also called alimentary canal tube transfers food organs digestion1 large bilaterians gastrointestinal tract generally also exit anus animal disposes feces solid wastes small bilaterians anus dispose solid wastes means example mouth2
gastrointestinal tract contains thousands different bacteria flora play important role immune system34
human gastrointestinal tract consists esophagus stomach intestines divided upper lower gastrointestinal tracts5 tract includes structures mouth anus6 forming continuous passageway includes main organs digestion namely stomach small intestine large intestine however complete human digestive system comprises gastrointestinal tract plus accessory organs digestion tongue salivary glands pancreas liver gallbladder7 tract also divided foregut midgut hindgut reflecting embryological origin segment
whole human tract nine metres feet long autopsy considerably shorter living body intestines tubes smooth muscle tissue maintain constant muscle tone somewhat like slinky maintains halfwaytense state relax spots allow local distention peristalsis oncitation needed
tract releases hormones enzymes help regulate digestive process hormones including gastrin secretin cholecystokinin ghrelin mediated either intracrine autocrine mechanisms indicating cells releasing hormones conserved structures throughout evolution8

gastrointestinal tract form general histology differences reflect specialization functional anatomy18 tract divided four concentric layers following order

mucosa
submucosa
muscular layer
adventitia serosa

mucosaedit
also oral mucosa gastric mucosa
mucosa innermost layer gastrointestinal tract surrounding lumen open space within tube layer comes direct contact digested food chyme mucosa made

epithelium innermost layer responsible digestive absorptive secretory processes
lamina propria layer connective tissue unusually cellular compared connective tissue
muscularis mucosae thin layer smooth muscle aids passing material enhances interaction epithelial layer contents lumen agitation peristalsis

mucosae highly specialized organ gastrointestinal tract deal different conditions variation seen epithelium
submucosaedit
main article submucosa
submucosa consists dense irregular layer connective tissue large blood vessels lymphatics nerves branching mucosa muscularis externa contains submucosal plexus enteric nervous plexus situated inner surface muscularis externa
muscular layeredit
muscular layer consists inner circular layer longitudinal outer layer circular layer prevents food traveling backward longitudinal layer shortens tract layers truly longitudinal circular rather layers muscle helical different pitches inner circular helical steep pitch outer longitudinal helical much shallower pitch19
muscle layers myenteric plexus controls peristalsis activity initiated pacemaker cells myenteric interstitial cells cajal intrinsic peristaltic activity basal electrical rhythm selfcontained enteric nervous system rate modulated rest autonomic nervous system19
coordinated contractions layers called peristalsis propels food tract food tract called bolus ball food mouth stomach stomach food partially digested semiliquid referred chyme large intestine remaining semisolid substance referred faeces19
adventitia serosaedit
main articles serous membrane adventitia
outermost layer gastrointestinal tract consists several layers connective tissue
intraperitoneal parts tract covered serosa include stomach first part duodenum small intestine caecum appendix transverse colon sigmoid colon rectum sections clear boundary surrounding tissue parts tract mesentery
retroperitoneal parts covered adventitia blend surrounding tissue fixed position example retroperitoneal section duodenum usually passes transpyloric plane include esophagus pylorus stomach distal duodenum ascending colon descending colon anal canal addition oral cavity adventitia
gene protein expressionedit
approximately 20000 protein coding genes expressed human cells genes expressed least different parts digestive organ system2021 genes specifically expressed parts tract corresponding proteins functions related digestion food uptake nutrients examples specific proteins functions pepsinogen lipase lipf expressed chief cells gastric atpase atp4a gastric intrinsic factor expressed parietal cells stomach mucosa specific proteins expressed stomach duodenum involved defence include mucin proteins mucin intelectin122
functionedit
time taken food ingested objects transit gastrointestinal tract varies depending many factors roughly takes less hour meal stomach contents empty intestines total emptying takes around hours subsequently emptying small intestine takes hours finally transit colon takes hours wide variation individuals2324
immune functionedit
immune barrieredit
gastrointestinal tract forms important part immune system25 surface area digestive tract estimated square meters half badminton court26 large exposure three times larger exposed surface skin immune components function prevent pathogens entering blood lymph circulatory systems27 fundamental components protection provided intestinal mucosal barrier composed physical biochemical immune elements elaborated intestinal mucosa28 microorganisms also kept extensive immune system comprising gutassociated lymphoid tissue galt
additional factors contributing protection pathogen invasion example ranging stomach fatal many microorganisms enter it29 similarly mucus containing antibodies neutralizes many pathogenic microorganisms30 factors tract contribution immune function include enzymes secreted saliva bile
immune system homeostasisedit
beneficial bacteria also contribute homeostasis gastrointestinal immune system example clostridia predominant bacterial groups tract play important role influencing dynamics guts immune system31 demonstrated intake high fiber diet could responsible induction tregulatory cells tregs production shortchain fatty acids fermentation plantderived nutrients butyrate propionate basically butyrate induces differentiation treg cells enhancing histone acetylation promoter conserved noncoding sequence regions foxp3 locus thus regulating cells resulting reduction inflammatory response allergies
intestinal microbiotaedit
large intestine hosts several kinds bacteria deal molecules human body cannot otherwise break down32 example symbiosis bacteria also account production gases hostpathogen interface inside intestinethis released flatulence eliminated anus however large intestine mainly concerned absorption water digested material regulated hypothalamus absorption sodium well nutrients escaped primary digestion ileumcitation needed
healthenhancing intestinal bacteria flora serve prevent overgrowth potentially harmful bacteria types bacteria compete space food limited resources within intestinal tract ratio 8085 beneficial 15–20 potentially harmful bacteria generally considered normal within intestinescitation needed
