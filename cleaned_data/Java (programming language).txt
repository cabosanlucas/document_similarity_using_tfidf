practices
java platform
main articles java software platform java virtual machine
design goal java portability means programs written java platform must similarly combination hardware operating system adequate runtime support achieved compiling java language code intermediate representation called java bytecode instead directly architecturespecific machine code java bytecode instructions analogous machine code intended executed virtual machine written specifically host hardware users commonly java runtime environment installed machine standalone java applications browser java applets
standard libraries provide generic access hostspecific features graphics threading networking
universal bytecode makes porting simple however overhead interpreting bytecode machine instructions made interpreted programs almost always slowly native executables justintime compilers compile bytecodes machine code runtime introduced early stage java platformindependent adapted particular platform java virtual machine translates java bytecode platforms machine language41
implementations
also free java implementations
oracle corporation current owner official implementation java platform following acquisition microsystems january 2010 implementation based original implementation java oracle implementation available microsoft windows still works later versions currently officially supported macos linux solaris java lacks formal standardization recognized ecma international isoiec ansi thirdparty standards organization oracle implementation facto standard
oracle implementation packaged different distributions java runtime environment contains parts java platform required java programs intended users java development intended software developers includes development tools java compiler javadoc debugger
openjdk another notable java implementation licensed implementation started began releasing java source code java openjdk official java reference implementation
goal java make implementations java compatible historically suns trademark license usage java brand insists implementations compatible resulted legal dispute microsoft claimed microsoft implementation support added platformspecific features sued 1997 2001 settlement us20 million well court order enforcing terms license sun42 result microsoft longer ships java windows
platformindependent java essential java even rigorous validation required certify implementation environment enables portable serverside applications
performance
main article java performance
programs written java reputation slower requiring memory written c4344 however java programs execution speed improved significantly introduction justintime compilation 19971998 java 1145 addition language features supporting better code analysis inner classes stringbuilder class optional assertions optimizations java virtual machine hotspot becoming default suns 2000 java performance improved addition javautilconcurrent package including lock free implementations concurrentmaps multicore collections improved java
platforms offer direct hardware support java microcontrollers java hardware instead software java virtual machinecitation needed based processors could hardware support executing java bytecode jazelle option though support mostly dropped current implementations
automatic memory management
java uses automatic garbage collector manage memory object lifecycle programmer determines objects created java runtime responsible recovering memory objects longer references object remain unreachable memory becomes eligible freed automatically garbage collector something similar memory leak still occur programmers code holds reference object longer needed typically objects longer needed stored containers still methods nonexistent object called null pointer exception thrown4647
ideas behind javas automatic memory management model programmers spared burden perform manual memory management languages memory creation objects implicitly allocated stack explicitly allocated deallocated heap latter case responsibility managing memory resides programmer program deallocate object memory leak occurs program attempts access deallocate memory already deallocated result undefined difficult predict program likely become unstable crash partially remedied smart pointers overhead complexity note garbage collection prevent logical memory leaks memory still referenced never used
garbage collection happen time ideally occur program idle guaranteed triggered insufficient free memory heap allocate object cause program stall momentarily explicit memory management possible java
java support style pointer arithmetic object addresses unsigned integers usually long integers used interchangeably allows garbage collector relocate referenced objects ensures type safety security
objectoriented languages variables javas primitive data types either stored directly fields objects stack methods rather heap commonly true nonprimitive data types escape analysis conscious decision javas designers performance reasons
java contains multiple types garbage collectors default hotspot uses parallel scavenge garbage collector48 however also several garbage collectors used manage heap applications java concurrent marksweep garbage collector sufficient49 oracle aims replace garbagefirst collector g150
syntax
main article java syntax
syntax java largely influenced unlike combines syntax structured generic objectoriented programming java built almost exclusively objectoriented language17 code written inside classes every data item object exception primitive data types integers floatingpoint numbers boolean values characters objects performance reasons java reuses popular aspects printf method
unlike java support operator overloading51 multiple inheritance classes though multiple inheritance supported interfaces52
java uses comments similar three different styles comments single line style marked slashes multiple line style opened closed javadoc commenting style opened closed javadoc style commenting allows user javadoc executable create documentation program read integrated development environments ides eclipse allow developers access documentation within
example


example single line comment using slashes

example multiple line comment using slash asterisk
type comment used hold information deactivate
code important remember close comment

package fibsandlies
import javautilhashmap


example javadoc comment javadoc compile documentation
text javadoc comments must immediately precede class method field documented

public class fibcalculator extends fibonacci implements calculator
private static mapinteger integer memoized hashmapinteger integer


main method written follows used starting point program

public static void mainstring args
memoizedput1
memoizedput2
systemoutprintlnfibonacci12 12th fibonacci number print console



example method written java wrapped class
given nonnegative number fibindex returns
fibonacci number equals fibindex
param fibindex index fibonacci number
return fibonacci number

public static fibonacciint fibindex
memoizedcontainskeyfibindex
return memoizedgetfibindex
else
answer fibonaccifibindex fibonaccifibindex
memoizedputfibindex answer
return answer




hello world example
traditional hello world program written java as53


class helloworldapp
public static void mainstring args
systemoutprintlnhello world prints string console



source files must named public class contain appending suffix java example helloworldappjava must first compiled bytecode using java compiler producing file named helloworldappclass executed launched java source file contain public class contain multiple classes public access number public inner classes source file contains multiple classes make class public name source file public class name
class declared public stored java file compiler generate class file class defined source file name class file name class class appended class file generation anonymous classes treated name concatenation name enclosing class integer
keyword public denotes method called code classes class used classes outside class hierarchy class hierarchy related name directory java file located called access level modifier access level modifiers include keywords private protected
keyword static front method indicates static method associated class specific instance class static methods invoked without reference object static methods cannot access class members also static methods designated static instance methods require specific instance class operate
keyword void indicates main method return value caller java program exit error code must call systemexit explicitly
method name main keyword java language simply name method java launcher calls pass control program java classes managed environments applets enterprise javabeans need main method java program contain multiple classes main methods means needs explicitly told class launch
main method must accept array string objects convention referenced args although legal identifier name used since java main method also variable arguments form public static void mainstring args allowing main method invoked arbitrary number string arguments effect alternate declaration semantically identical args parameter still array string objects allows alternative syntax creating passing array
java launcher launches java loading given class specified command line attribute starting public static void mainstring method standalone programs must declare method explicitly string args parameter array string objects containing arguments passed class parameters main often passed means command line
printing part java standard library system class defines public static field called object instance printstream class provides many methods printing data standard including printlnstring also appends line passed string
string hello world automatically converted string object compiler
