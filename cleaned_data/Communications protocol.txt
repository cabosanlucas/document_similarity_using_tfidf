basic requirementsedit
getting data across network part problem protocol data received evaluated context progress conversation protocol therefore must include rules describing context kind rules said express syntax communication rules determine whether data meaningful context exchange takes place kind rules said express semantics communication
messages sent received communicating systems establish communication protocols therefore specify rules governing transmission general much following addressed13

data formats data exchange
digital message bitstrings exchanged bitstrings divided fields field carries information relevant protocol conceptually bitstring divided parts called header payload actual message carried payload header area contains fields relevance operation protocol bitstrings longer maximum transmission unit divided pieces appropriate size14
address formats data exchange
addresses used identify sender intended receivers addresses carried header area bitstrings allowing receivers determine whether bitstrings interest processed ignored connection sender receiver identified using address pair sender address receiver address usually address values special meanings all1s address could taken mean addressing stations network sending address would result broadcast local network rules describing meanings address value collectively called addressing scheme15
address mapping
sometimes protocols need addresses scheme addresses another scheme instance translate logical address specified application ethernet address referred address mapping16
routing
systems directly connected intermediary systems along route intended receivers need forward messages behalf sender internet networks connected using routers interconnection networks routers called internetworking
detection transmission errors
error detection necessary networks data corruption possible common approach crcs data area added packets making possible receiver detect differences caused corruption receiver rejects packets differences arranges somehow retransmission17
acknowledgements
acknowledgement correct reception packets required connectionoriented communication acknowledgements sent receivers back respective senders18
loss information timeouts retries
packets lost network delayed transit cope protocols sender expect acknowledgement correct reception receiver within certain amount time timeouts sender must assume packet received retransmit case permanently broken link retransmission effect number retransmissions limited exceeding retry limit considered error19
direction information flow
direction needs addressed transmissions occur direction time halfduplex links sender time shared medium known media access control arrangements made accommodate case collision contention parties respectively simultaneously transmit wish transmit20
sequence control
long bitstrings divided pieces sent network individually pieces lost delayed types networks take different routes destination result pieces arrive sequence retransmissions result duplicate pieces marking pieces sequence information sender receiver determine lost duplicated necessary retransmissions reassemble original message21
flow control
flow control needed sender transmits faster receiver intermediate network equipment process transmissions flow control implemented messaging receiver sender22

universal protocolsedit


nice thing standards many choose


—andrew tanenbaum computer networks23


despite numbers networking protocols show little variety networking protocols underlying principles concepts general purpose programming language would yield large number applications differing details24 suitably defined dedicated protocolling language would therefore little syntax perhaps enough specify parameters optional modes operation virtual machine would incorporated possible principles concepts making virtual machine universal protocol protocolling language would syntax semantics describing universal protocol would therefore effect protocol hardly differing universal networking protocol networking context protocol language
notion universal networking protocol provides rationale standardization networking protocols assuming existence universal networking protocol development protocol standards using consensus model agreement group experts might viable coordinate protocol design efforts
networking protocols operate heterogeneous environments consisting different network technologies possibly rich applications single universal protocol would hard design implement correctly instead ietf decided reduce complexity assuming relatively simple network architecture allowing decomposition single universal networking protocol generic protocols classes specific protocols dealing lowlevel network details dealing highlevel details common network applications remote login file transfer email browsing choose similar general path allowing network architectures standardize protocols
protocol designedit

figure tcpip model internet layering scheme relation common protocols


modern protocol design protocols layered layering design principle divides protocol design task smaller steps accomplishes specific part interacting parts protocol small number welldefined ways layering allows parts protocol designed tested without combinatorial explosion cases keeping design relatively simple layering also permits familiar protocols adapted unusual circumstances example mail protocol adapted send messages aircraft changing modem protocol inmars lapd data protocol used international marine radio satellites
communication protocols internet designed function diverse complex settings internet protocols designed simplicity modularity interoperating coarse hierarchy functional layers traditionally called tcpip model internet protocol suite31 name tcpip arose first cooperating protocols transmission control protocol internet protocol resulted decomposition original transmission control program monolithic communication protocol first layers communication suite model expanded four layers additional protocols however internet protocol development focussed principle layering mandatory recipe communication rather evolved convenient description modularity protocol cooperation
different model seven layer model developed internationally rigorous reference model general communication much stricter rules protocol interaction rigorous layering concept functionality
typically application software built upon robust data transport layer underlying transport layer datagram delivery routing mechanism typically connectionless internet packet relaying across networks happens another layer involves network link technologies often specific certain physical layer technologies ethernet layering provides opportunities exchange technologies needed example protocols often stacked tunneling arrangement accommodate connection dissimilar networks example tunneled across asynchronous transfer mode network
protocol layeringedit




figure message flows using protocol suite black loops show actual messaging loops loops effective communication layers enabled lower layers


protocol layering forms basis protocol design9 allows decomposition single complex protocols simpler cooperating protocols also functional decomposition protocol belongs functional class called protocol layer31 protocol layers solve distinct class communication problems internet protocol suite consists following layers application transport internet network interfacefunctions11 together layers make layering scheme model
computations deal algorithms data communication involves protocols messages analog data flow diagram kind message flow diagram4 visualize protocol layering protocol suites diagram message flows systems shown figure
systems make protocol suite vertical flows protocols system horizontal message flows protocols systems message flows governed rules data formats specified protocols blue lines therefore mark boundaries horizontal protocol layers
vertical protocols layered dont obey protocol layering principle states layered protocol designed layer destination receives exactly object sent layer source horizontal protocols layered protocols belong protocol suite layered protocols allow protocol designer concentrate layer time without worrying layers perform30
vertical protocols need protocols systems satisfy minimal assumptions ensure protocol layering principle holds layered protocols achieved using technique called encapsulation32
usually message stream data divided small pieces called messages streams packets datagrams network frames depending layer pieces transmitted pieces contain header area data area data header area identifies source destination network packet protocol data meaningful protocol like crcs data sent data length timestamp3334
rule enforced vertical protocols pieces transmission encapsulated data area lower protocols sending side reverse happen receiving side result lowest level piece looks like header1header2header3data layer directly header2header3data layer header3data sending receiving side rule therefore ensures protocol layering principle holds effectively virtualizes lowest transmission lines reason message flows coloured figure
ensure sides protocol pieces also carry data identifying protocol header
design protocol layering network internet architecture interrelated cannot designed without other35 important features respect internet architecture network services provides described next

internet offers universal interconnection means pair computers connected internet allowed communicate computer identified address internet interconnected physical networks appear user single large network interconnection scheme called internetwork internet36
conceptually internet addresses consists netid hostid netid identifies network hostid identifies host term host misleading individual computer multiple network interfaces internet address internet address identifies connection network individual computer37 netid used routers decide send packet38
network technology independence achieved using lowlevel address resolution protocol used internet addresses physical addresses mapping called address resolution physical addresses used protocols network interface layer39 tcpip protocols make almost underlying communication technology40

physical networks interconnected routers routers forward packets interconnected networks making possible hosts reach hosts physical networks message flows communicating systems presence router illustrated figure datagrams passed router router router reached deliver datagram physically attached network called direct delivery41 decide whether datagram delivered directly sent router closer destination table called routing table consulted table consists pairs networkids paths taken reach known networks path indication datagram delivered directly address router known closer destination42 special entry specify default router chosen known paths43
networks treated equal pointtopoint link computers considered network44
connectionless packet delivery packetswitched system service offered internet adapts well different hardware including besteffort delivery mechanisms like ethernet connectionless delivery means messages streams divided pieces multiplexed separately high speed intermachine connections allowing connections used concurrently piece carries information identifying destination delivery packets said unreliable packets lost duplicated delayed delivered order without notice sender receiver unreliability arises resources exhausted underlying networks fail45 unreliable connectionless delivery system defined internet protocol protocol also specifies routing function chooses path data sent46 also possible tcpip protocols connection oriented systems connection oriented systems build virtual circuits paths exclusive senders receivers built datagrams sent data virtual circuits forwarded data protocol modules technique called tunneling used networks networks47

tcpip software organized four layers53

application layer highest layer services available across tcpip internet accessed application programs application chooses style transport used sequence individual messages continuous stream bytes application program passes data transport layer delivery
transport layer transport layer provides communication application another transport layer regulate flow information provide reliable transport ensuring data arrives without error sequence receiving side sends back acknowledgments sending side retransmits lost pieces called packets stream data divided packets module packet passed along destination address next layer transmission layer must accept data many applications concurrently therefore also includes codes packet header identify sending receiving application program
internet layer internet layer handles communication machines packets sent accepted transport layer along identification receiving machine packets encapsulated datagrams datagram headers filled routing algorithm used determine datagram delivered directly sent router datagram passed appropriate network interface transmission incoming datagrams checked validity routing algorithm used decide whether datagram processed locally forwarded datagram addressed local machine datagram header deleted appropriate transport protocol packet chosen icmp error control messages handled well layer
network interface layer network interface layer responsible accepting datagrams transmitting specific network network interface consist device driver complex subsystem uses data link protocol

program translation divided four subproblems compiler assembler link editor loader result translation software layered well allowing software layers designed independently noting ways conquer complexity program translation could readily applied protocols analogy programming languages protocols designers tcpip protocol suite keen imposing layering software framework seen tcpip layering considering translation pascal program message compiled function application layer assembler program assembled function transport layer object code pieces linked function internet layer together library object code routing table link editor producing relocatable machine code datagram passed loader fills memory locations ethernet addresses produce executable code network frame loaded function network interface layer physical memory transmission medium show closely analogy fits terms parentheses previous sentence denote relevant analogs terms written cursively denote data representations program translation forms linear sequence layers output passed input next layer furthermore translation process involves multiple data representations thing happening protocol software multiple protocols define data representations data passed software modules54
network interface layer uses physical addresses layers addresses boundary network interface layer internet layer called highlevel protocol address boundary55 modules application layer generally considered part operating system passing data modules much less expensive passing data application program transport layer boundary application layer transport layer called operating system boundary56
strict layeringedit
strictly adhering layered model practice known strict layering always best approach networking57 strict layering serious impact performance implementation least tradeoff simplicity performance58 another perhaps important point shown considering fact protocols internet protocol suite cannot expressed using tcpip model words protocols behave ways described model59 improve model offending protocol could perhaps split protocols cost extra layers hidden caveat model also used provide conceptual view suite intended users tradeoff made preciseness designer clarity intended user60
design patterns application layer protocolsedit
commonly reoccurring problems occur design implementation communication protocols addressed patterns several different pattern languages pattern language applicationlevel communication protocols commdp6162 service design patterns63 patterns enterprise application architecture64 patternoriented software architecture pattern language distributed computing65 first pattern languages focuses design protocols implementations others address issues either areas latter
formal specificationedit
formal methods describing communication syntax abstract syntax notation standard augmented backusnaur form ietf standard
finite state machine models6667 communicating finitestate machines68 used formally describe possible interactions protocol
protocol developmentedit
communication take place protocols agreed upon recall digital computing systems rules expressed algorithms datastructures raising opportunity hardware independence expressing algorithms portable programming language makes protocol software operating system independent source code could considered protocol specification form specification however suitable parties involved
thing would enforce source parties another proprietary software producers would accept describing software interfaces modules paper agreeing interfaces implementers free referred source independence specifying algorithms paper detailing hardware dependencies unambiguous paper draft created adhered published ensures interoperability software hardware
paper draft developed protocol standard getting approval standards organization approval paper draft needs enter successfully complete standardization process activity referred protocol development members standards organization agree adhere standard voluntary basis often members control large marketshares relevant protocol many cases standards enforced government thought serve important public interest getting approval important protocol
noted though cases protocol standards sufficient gain widespread acceptance sometimes source code needs disclosed enforced government interest public
need protocol standardsedit
need protocol standards shown looking happened bisync protocol invented early linklevel protocol used connect separate nodes originally intended used multinode network revealed several deficiencies protocol absence standardization manufacturers organizations felt free enhance protocol creating incompatible versions networks cases deliberately done discourage users using equipment manufacturers variants original bisync protocol assume standard would prevented least happening7
cases protocols gain market dominance without going standardization process protocols referred facto standards facto standards common emerging markets niche markets markets monopolized oligopolized hold market negative grip especially used scare away competition historical perspective standardization seen measure counteract illeffects facto standards positive exceptions exist facto standard operating system like gnulinux negative grip market sources published maintained open thus inviting competition standardization therefore solution open systems interconnection
standards organizationsedit
standards organizations relevance communication protocols international organization standardization international telecommunication union institute electrical electronics engineers ieee internet engineering task force ietf ietf maintains protocols internet ieee controls many software hardware protocols electronics industry commercial consumer devices umbrella organization telecommunication engineers designing public switched telephone network pstn well many radio communication systems marine electronics nmea standards used world wide consortium produces protocols standards technologies
international standards organizations supposed impartial local organizations national commercial selfinterest consider standards organizations also research development standards future practice standards organizations mentioned cooperate closely other69
standardization processedit
standardization process starts commissioning subcommittee workgroup workgroup issues working drafts discussion documents interested parties including standards bodies order provoke discussion comments generate questions much discussion usually disagreement standard provide satisfy needs usually conflicting views taken account often compromise progress draft proposal working group
draft proposal discussed member countries standard bodies organizations within country comments suggestions collated national views formulated members vote proposal rejected draft proposal consider objections counterproposals create draft proposal another vote feedback modification compromise proposal reaches status draft international standard ultimately international standard
process normally takes several years complete original paper draft created designer differ substantially standard contain following features

various optional modes operation example allow setup different packet sizes startup time parties could reach consensus optimum packet size
parameters left undefined allowed take values defined discretion implementor often reflects conflicting views members
parameters reserved future reflecting members agreed facility provided could reach agreement done available time
various inconsistencies ambiguities inevitably found implementing standard

international standards reissued periodically handle deficiencies reflect changing views subject70
future standardization osiedit
lesson learned arpanet predecessor internet standardization protocols enough protocols also need framework operate therefore important develop generalpurpose futureproof framework suitable structured protocols layered protocols standardization would prevent protocol standards overlapping functionality would allow clear definition responsibilities protocol different levels layers71 gave rise open systems interconnection reference model rmosi used framework design standard protocols services conforming various layer specifications72
model communicating systems assumed connected underlying physical medium providing basic unspecified transmission mechanism layers numbered seven layer referred nlayer layer provides service layer application process using services layer immediately layers communicate means interface called service access point corresponding layers system called peer entities communicate peer entities given layer nprotocol implemented using services n1layer systems directly connected intermediate peer entities called relays used address uniquely identifies service access point address naming domains need restricted layer possible naming domain layers73 layer types standards protocol standards defining peer entities given layer communicate service standards defining given layer communicates layer
original version rmosi layers functionality highest lowest layer

application layer provide following services application processes identification intended communication partners establishment necessary authority communicate determination availability authentication partners agreement privacy mechanisms communication agreement responsibility error recovery procedures ensuring data integrity synchronization cooperating application processes identification constraints syntax character sets data structures determination cost acceptable quality service selection dialogue discipline including required logon logoff procedures74
presentation layer provide following services application layer request establishment session data transfer negotiation syntax used application layers necessary syntax transformations formatting special purpose transformations data compression data encryption75
session layer provide following services presentation layer establishment release session connections normal expedited data exchange quarantine service allows sending presentation entity instruct receiving session entity release data presentation entity without permission interaction management presentation entities control whose turn perform certain control functions resynchronization session connection reporting unrecoverable exceptions presentation entity76
transport layer provides reliable transparent data transfer costeffective required selected quality service support multiplexing several transport connections network connection split transport connection several network connections77
network layer setup maintenance release network paths transport peer entities relays needed routing relay functions provided layer quality service negotiated network transport entities time connection layer also responsible network congestion control78
data link layer setup maintenance release data link connections errors occurring physical layer detected corrected errors reported network layer exchange data link units including flow control defined layer79
physical layer describes details like electrical characteristics physical connection transmission techniques used setup maintenance clearing physical connections80

contrast tcpip layering scheme assumes connectionless network rmosi assumed connectionoriented network connectionoriented networks suitable wide area networks connectionless networks suitable local area networks using connections communicate implies form session virtual circuits hence tcpip model lacking session layer constituent members mostly concerned wide area networks development rmosi concentrated connection oriented networks connectionless networks mentioned addendum rmosi81 time ietf cope fact internet needed protocols simply result ietf developed standardization process based rough consensus running code82
standardization process described rfc2026
nowadays ietf become standards organization protocols internet rmosi extended model include connectionless services could developed international standards
taxonomiesedit
classification schemes protocols usually focus domain function example domain connectionoriented protocols connectionless protocols used connectionoriented networks connectionless networks respectively example function consider tunneling protocol used encapsulate packets highlevel protocol packets passed across transport system using highlevel protocol
layering scheme combines function domain dominant layering schemes ones proposed ietf despite fact underlying assumptions layering schemes different enough warrant distinguishing common practice compare relating common protocols layers schemes83 example practice lists network protocols
