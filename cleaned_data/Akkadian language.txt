akkadian preserved clay tablets dating back 2500 written using cuneiform script adopted sumerians using wedgeshaped symbols pressed clay employed akkadian scribes adapted cuneiform script could represent either sumerian logograms picturebased characters representing entire words sumerian syllables akkadian syllables phonetic complements however akkadian script practically became fully fledged syllabic script original logographic nature cuneiform became secondary though logograms frequent words temple continued used reason sign hand logogram word ilum signify even syllable additionally sign used determinative divine names
another peculiarity akkadian cuneiform many signs welldefined phonetic value certain signs distinguish different vowel qualities coordination direction syllable example rendered sign also sign often used syllable text
cuneiform many ways unsuited akkadian among flaws inability represent important phonemes semitic including glottal stop pharyngeals emphatic consonants addition cuneiform syllabary writing system—ie consonant plus vowel comprised writing unit—frequently inappropriate semitic language made triconsonantal roots three consonants plus vowels

reconstructionedit
akkadian emphatic consonants typically reconstructed ejectives thought oldest realization emphatics across semitic languages15 sibilants traditionally held postalveolar analyzed fricatives attested assimilations akkadian suggest otherwise316 example possessive suffix added root awat word written awassu word even though would expected straightforward interpretation shift form pair voiceless coronal affricates t͡sʼ voiceless coronal fricative voiced coronal affricate fricative d͡zz assimilation awatsu awatt͡su vein alternative transcription macron indicating soft lenis articulation semitic transcription interpretations possible however could assimilated preceding yielding would later simplified

stress patterns akkadian disputed authors claiming nothing known topic however certain points reference rule vowel syncope next paragraph forms cuneiform might represent stressing certain vowels however attempts identifying rule stress unsuccessful
huenergard 200534 claims stress akkadian completely predictable syllable typology three syllable weights light heavy superheavy cv̂c last syllable superheavy stressed otherwise rightmost heavy syllable stressed word contains light syllables first syllable stressed
