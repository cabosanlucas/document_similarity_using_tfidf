vague exaggerated untestable claimsedit

assertion scientific claims vague rather precise lack specific measurements43
assertion claim little explanatory power31
failure make operational definitions publicly accessible definitions variables terms objects interest persons definer measure test independentlynote also reproducibility
failure make reasonable principle parsimony failing seek explanation requires fewest possible additional assumptions multiple viable explanations possible occams razor45
obscurantist language apparently technical jargon effort give claims superficial trappings science
lack boundary conditions wellsupported scientific theories possess wellarticulated limitations predicted phenomena apply46
lack effective controls placebo doubleblind experimental design
lack understanding basic established principles physics engineering47

overreliance confirmation rather refutationedit

assertions allow logical possibility shown false observation physical experiment also falsifiability1748
assertion claims theory predicts something shown predict49 scientific claims confer predictive power considered best conjectures worst pseudoscience ignoratio elenchi50
assertion claims proven false must therefore true vice versa argument ignorance51
overreliance testimonial anecdotal evidence personal experience evidence useful context discovery hypothesis generation used context justification statistical hypothesis testing52
presentation data seems support claims suppressing refusing consider data conflict claims25 example selection bias distortion evidence data arises data collected sometimes referred selection effect
promulgating status facts excessive untested claims previously published elsewhere accumulation uncritical secondary reports otherwise contribute empirical investigation called woozle effect53
reversed burden proof science places burden proof making claim critic pseudoscientific arguments neglect principle demand skeptics demonstrate beyond reasonable doubt claim assertion regarding efficacy novel therapeutic technique false essentially impossible prove universal negative tactic incorrectly places burden proof skeptic rather claimant54
appeals holism opposed reductionism proponents pseudoscientific claims especially organic medicine alternative medicine naturopathy mental health often resort mantra holism dismiss negative findings55

lack openness testing expertsedit

evasion peer review publicizing results termed science press conference5456note proponents ideas contradict accepted scientific theories avoid subjecting ideas peer review sometimes grounds peer review biased towards established paradigms sometimes grounds assertions cannot evaluated adequately using standard scientific methods remaining insulated peer review process proponents forgo opportunity corrective feedback informed colleagues55
agencies institutions publications fund scientific research require authors share data others evaluate paper independently failure provide adequate information researchers reproduce claims contributes lack openness57

personalization issuesedit

tight social groups authoritarian personality suppression dissent groupthink enhance adoption beliefs rational basis attempting confirm beliefs group tends identify critics enemies61
