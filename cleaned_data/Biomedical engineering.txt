increasing number undergraduate programs also becoming recognized abet accredited bioengineeringbiomedical engineering programs programs currently accredited abet1314
canada australia accredited graduate programs biomedical engineering common example universities mcmaster university first canadian undergraduate program ryerson university offering fouryear beng program15161718 polytechnique montreal also offering bachelorss degree biomedical engineering
many degrees reputation ranking program factor desirability degree holder either employment graduate admission reputation many undergraduate degrees also linked institutions graduate research programs tangible factors rating research funding volume publications citations specifically ranking universitys hospital medical school also significant factor perceived prestige departmentprogram
graduate education particularly important aspect many engineering fields mechanical electrical engineering need graduatelevel training obtain entrylevel field majority positions prefer even require them19 since bmerelated professions involve scientific research pharmaceutical medical device development graduate education almost requirement undergraduate degrees typically involve sufficient research training experience either masters doctoral level degree certain specialties notably common others hardly ever majority except academia fact perceived need kind graduate credential strong undergraduate programs actively discourage students majoring without expressed intention also obtain masters degree apply medical school afterwards
graduate programs like scientific fields highly varied particular programs emphasize certain aspects within field also feature extensive collaborative efforts programs fields universitys medical school engineering divisions owing interdisciplinary nature programs typically require applicants undergraduate degree another engineering discipline plus certain life science coursework life science plus certain engineering coursework
education also varies greatly around world virtue extensive biotechnology sector numerous major universities relatively internal barriers progressed great deal development education training opportunities europe also large biotechnology sector impressive education system encountered trouble creating uniform standards european community attempts supplant national jurisdictional barriers still exist recently initiatives biomedea sprung develop bmerelated education professional standards20 countries australia recognizing moving correct deficiencies education21 also high technology endeavors usually marks developed nations areas world prone slower development education including
licensurecertificationedit
also professional engineer
engineering licensure largely optional rarely specified branchdiscipline learned professions state certain fairly similar requirements becoming licensed registered professional engineer practice license required practice majority situations exception known private industry exemption effectively applies vast majority american engineers notably case many countries license legally necessary practice engineering medicine
biomedical engineering regulated countries australia registration typically recommended required22
mechanical engineers working areas medical engineering bioengineering biomedical engineering gain chartered engineer status institution mechanical engineers institution also runs engineering medicine health division23 institute physics engineering medicine ipem panel accreditation courses biomedical engineering chartered engineering status also sought ipem
fundamentals engineering exam first general licensure examinations jurisdictions—does cover biology although technically second exam called principles practices part professional engineering exam candidates select particular engineering disciplines content tested currently option meaning biomedical engineers seeking license must prepare take examination another category affect actual license since jurisdictions recognize discipline specialties anyway however biomedical engineering society bmes 2009 exploring possibility seeking implement bmespecific version exam facilitate biomedical engineers pursuing licensure
beyond governmental registration certain privatesector professionalindustrial organizations also offer certifications varying degrees prominence example certified clinical engineer certification clinical engineers
