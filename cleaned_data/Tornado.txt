tornadoes emit widely acoustics spectrum sounds caused multiple mechanisms various sounds tornadoes reported mostly related familiar sounds witness generally variation whooshing roar popularly reported sounds include freight train rushing rapids waterfall nearby engine combinations many tornadoes audible much distance nature propagation distance audible sound depends atmospheric conditions topography
winds tornado vortex constituent turbulent eddies well airflow interaction surface debris contribute sounds funnel clouds also produce sounds funnel clouds small tornadoes reported whistling whining humming buzzing innumerable bees electricity less harmonic whereas many tornadoes reported continuous deep rumbling irregular sound noise42
since many tornadoes audible near sound thought reliable warning signal tornado tornadoes also source sounds severe thunderstorms strong damaging wind severe hail volley continuous thunder thunderstorm produce roaring sound43
tornadoes also produce identifiable inaudible infrasonic signatures44
unlike audible signatures tornadic signatures isolated long distance propagation lowfrequency sound efforts ongoing develop tornado prediction detection devices additional value understanding tornado morphology dynamics creation45 tornadoes also produce detectable seismic signature research continues isolating understanding process46

supercell relationship
also supercell
tornadoes often develop class thunderstorms known supercells supercells contain mesocyclones area organized rotation miles atmosphere usually miles 16–97 kilometres across intense tornadoes enhanced fujita scale develop supercells addition tornadoes heavy rain frequent lightning strong wind gusts hail common storms
tornadoes supercells follow recognizable life cycle begins increasing rainfall drags area quickly descending known rear flank downdraft downdraft accelerates approaches ground drags supercells rotating mesocyclone towards ground it17
formation
mesocyclone lowers cloud base begins take cool moist downdraft region storm convergence warm updraft cool causes rotating wall cloud form also focuses mesocyclones base causing draw smaller smaller area ground updraft intensifies creates area pressure surface pulls focused mesocyclone form visible condensation funnel funnel descends also reaches ground fanning outward creating gust front cause severe damage considerable distance tornado usually funnel cloud begins causing damage ground becoming tornado within minutes reaching ground1751
maturity
initially tornado good source warm moist flowing inward power grows reaches mature stage last anywhere minutes hour time tornado often causes damage rare cases mile across pressured atmosphere base tornado essential endurance system52 meanwhile area cool surface winds begins wrap around tornado cutting inflow warm previously tornado17
dissipation
completely wraps around chokes tornados supply vortex begins weaken become thin ropelike dissipating stage often lasting minutes tornado ends stage shape tornado becomes highly influenced winds parent storm blown fantastic patterns223031 even though tornado dissipating still capable causing damage storm contracting ropelike tube conservation angular momentum winds increase point26
tornado enters dissipating stage associated mesocyclone often weakens well rear flank downdraft cuts inflow powering sometimes intense supercells tornadoes develop cyclically first mesocyclone associated tornado dissipate storms inflow concentrated area closer center storm possibly feed mesocyclone mesocyclone develops cycle start producing tornadoes occasionally occluded mesocyclone mesocyclone produce tornado time
