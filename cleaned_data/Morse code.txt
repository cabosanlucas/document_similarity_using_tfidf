morse code receiver recording paper tape


beginning 1836 american artist samuel morse american physicist joseph henry alfred vail developed electrical telegraph system system sent pulses electric current along wires controlled electromagnet located receiving telegraph system code needed transmit natural language using pulses silence around 1837 morse therefore developed early forerunner modern international morse code around time carl friedrich gauss wilhelm eduard weber 1833 well carl august steinheil 1837 already used codes varying word lengths telegraphs since around 1800 european experimenters making progress earlier batterypowered signaling systems emitting oxygen hydrogen bubbles liquid flipping magnetic semaphore flags tripping alarms across long distances wire techniques numerous ingenious experimental encoding designs devised demonstrated telegraphic precursors practical applications2
1837 william cooke charles wheatstone england began using electrical telegraph also used electromagnets receivers however contrast system making sounds clicks system used pointing needles rotated alphabetical charts indicate letters sent 1841 cooke wheatstone built telegraph printed letters wheel typefaces struck hammer machine based 1840 telegraph worked well however failed find customers system examples ever built3
hand three americans system telegraphy first used 1844 designed make indentations paper tape electric currents received morses original telegraph receiver used mechanical clockwork move paper tape electrical current received electromagnet engaged armature pushed stylus onto moving paper tape making indentation tape current interrupted spring retracted stylus portion moving tape remained unmarked
morse code developed operators could translate indentations marked paper tape text messages earliest code morse planned transmit numerals codebook look word according number sent however code soon expanded alfred vail 1840 include letters special characters could used generally vail estimated frequency letters english language counting movable type found typecases local newspaper morristown4 shorter marks called dots longer ones dashes letters commonly used assigned shorter sequences dots dashes code used since 1844 became known morse landline code american morse code

original morse telegraphs receivers armature made clicking noise moved position mark paper tape telegraph operators soon learned could translate clicks directly dots dashes write hand thus making paper tape unnecessary morse code adapted radio communication dots dashes sent short long tone pulses later found people become proficient receiving morse code taught language heard instead read page5
reflect sounds morse code receivers operators began vocalize dash dots final element character became vocalized example letter vocalized dahdidahdit67 morse code sometimes facetiously known iddyumpty dash umpty leading word umpteen8
morse code used internationally today derived much refined proposal became known hamburg alphabet friedrich clemens gerke 1848 adopted deutschösterreichischer telegraphenverein germanaustrian telegraph society 1851 finally international morse code 1865
1890s morse code began used extensively early radio communication possible transmit voice late 19th early 20th centuries highspeed international communication used morse code telegraph lines undersea cables radio circuits aviation morse code radio systems started used regular basis 1920s although previous transmitters bulky spark system transmission difficult earlier attempts 1910 navy experimented sending morse airplane9 year radio airship america instrumental coordinating rescue crew10 zeppelin airships equipped radio used bombing naval scouting world groundbased radio direction finders used airship navigation11 allied airships military aircraft also made radiotelegraphy however little aeronautical radio general world 1920s radio system used important flights charles lindbergh york paris 1927 spirit louis ground lindbergh truly alone incommunicado hand first airplane flight made california australia 1928 southern cross four crewmen radio operator communicated ground stations radio telegraph

link budget issues
morse code cannot treated classical radioteletype rtty signal comes calculating link margin link budget simple reason possessing variable length dots dashes well variant timing letters words purposes information theory channel coding comparisons word paris used determine morse codes properties even number dots dashes
morse code transmitted essentially creates signal even onoff keying mode assumptions signal made respect similarly timed rtty signalling morse code transmissions employ onoff keyed radio signal requires less complex transmission equipment forms radio communication
morse code also requires less signal bandwidth voice communication typically 100–150 compared roughly 2400 used singlesideband voice although lower data rate
morse code usually heard receiver mediumpitched onoff audio tone 600–1000 transmissions easier copy voice noise congested frequencies used high noise signal environments transmitted power concentrated limited bandwidth narrow receiver filters used suppress interference adjacent frequencies audio tone usually created beat frequency oscillator
narrow signal bandwidth also takes advantage natural aural selectivity human brain enhancing weak signal readability efficiency makes extremely useful distance transmissions well lowpower transmissions commonly called operation qcode reduce power
