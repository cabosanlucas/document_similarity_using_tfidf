historyedit
earlier effortsedit
much history computer language design 1960s traces history algol language algol developed 1950s explicit goal able clearly describe algorithms included number features structured programming remain common languages
shortly introduction 1962 wirth began working dissertation helmut weber euler programming language euler based algols syntax many concepts derivative primary goal dynamic lists types allowing used roles similar lisp language published 1965
time number problems algol identified notably lack standardized string system group tasked maintaining language begun algol process identify improvements calling submissions wirth tony hoare submitted conservative modifications strings clean syntax considered minor worth using standard algol wirth wrote compiler language became known algol
algol efforts would choose dramatically complex language algol complexity language considerable difficulty producing highperformance compilers widely used industry left opening newer languages
pascaledit
pascal influenced algol efforts explicit goals producing language would efficient compiler runtime allow development wellstructured programs useful teaching students structured programming4 generation students used pascal introductory language undergraduate courses
early successes language introduction ucsd pascal version custom operating system could ported different platforms platform apple widespread pascal becoming primary highlevel language used development apple lisa later macintosh parts original macintosh operating system handtranslated motorola 68000 assembly language pascal sources5
typesetting system donald knuth written original literate programming system based pdp10 pascal applications like total commander skype macromedia captivate written delphi object pascal apollo computer used pascal systems programming language operating systems beginning 1980
variants pascal also frequently used everything research projects games embedded systems newer pascal compilers exist widely used6
object pascaledit
work lisa larry tesler began corresponding wirth idea adding object oriented extensions language initially clascal introduced 1983 lisa program faded replaced version known object pascal created introduced macintosh 1985 part macapp application framework became apples primary development language early 1990s
object pascal extensions later added turbo pascal years became delphi system microsoft windows delphi still used developing windows applications also ability crosscompile code android another crossplatform version called free pascal lazarus popular linux users since also offers write compile anywhere development codetyphon lazarus distribution preinstalled packages crosscompilers
brief descriptionedit
wirths intention create efficient language regarding compilation speed generated code based structured programming recently popularized concept promoted book algorithms data structures programs pascal roots algol language also introduced concepts mechanisms algols scalars arrays enabled programmers define complex structured datatypes also made easier build dynamic recursive data structures lists trees graphs important features included records enumerations subranges dynamically allocated variables associated pointers sets make possible meaningful pascal strong typing objects means type data cannot converted interpreted another without explicit conversions similar mechanisms standard many programming languages today languages influenced pascals development simula wirths algol
pascal like many programming languages today unlike languages family allows nested procedure definitions level depth also allows kinds definitions declarations inside subroutines procedures functions enables simple coherent syntax complete program syntactically nearly identical single procedure function except heading three keywords
implementationsedit
early pascal compilersedit
first pascal compiler designed zürich 6000 series mainframe computer family niklaus wirth reports first attempt implement fortran 1969 unsuccessful fortrans inadequacy express complex data structures second attempt implemented clike language scallop engeli translated hand schild pascal bootstrapping7 operational mid1970 many pascal compilers since similarly selfhosting compiler written pascal compiler usually capable recompiling features added language compiler ported environment pascal compiler notable exception written

early 1980s watcom pascal developed also system
1990s pascal still running terminals george mason university teach computer programming
object pascal turbo pascaledit
apple computer created lisa pascal lisa workshop 1982 ported compiler apple macintosh 1985 1985 larry tesler consultation niklaus wirth defined object pascal extensions incorporated lisa pascal pascal compilers
1980s anders hejlsberg wrote blue label pascal compiler nascom2 reimplementation compiler marketed names compas pascal polypascal acquired borland renamed turbo pascal
turbo pascal became hugely popular thanks aggressive pricing strategy first fullscreen integrated development environments fast turnaround time seconds compile link written highly optimized entirely assembly language making smaller faster much competition
1986 anders ported turbo pascal macintosh incorporated apples object pascal extensions turbo pascal extensions added back version turbo pascal version time microsoft also implemented object pascal compiler1011 turbo pascal large influence pascal community began concentrating mainly late 1980s many hobbyists search structured replacement basic used product also began adopted professional developers around time number concepts imported pascal programmers cbased microsoft windows directly extensions included nullterminated strings pointer arithmetic function pointers addressof operator unsafe typecasts
turbo pascal derivatives units module concepts modular languages however provide nested module concept qualified import export specific symbols

smart mobile studio20 created aasenden compiles dialect object pascal html5javascript
smart mobile studio includes visual component language unusual incorporates extensions javascript language
language constructsedit
pascal original form purely procedural language includes traditional array algollike control structures reserved words else case ranging single statement beginend statements block pascal also data structuring constructs included original algol types like records variants pointers enumerations sets procedurepointers constructs part inherited inspired simula algol niklaus wirths algol suggestions hoare
pascal programs start program keyword list external file descriptors parameters21 required turbo pascal follows main block bracketed begin keywords semicolons separate statements full stop period ends whole program unit letter case ignored pascal source
example source code simple hello world program


program helloworldoutput

writehello world
required last statement block
adding adds null statement program


data typesedit
type pascal several popular programming languages defines variable defines range values variable capable storing also defines operations permissible performed variables type predefined types


data type
type values variable capable storing


integer
integer whole numbers


real
floatingpoint numbers


boolean
value true false


char
single character ordered character


string
group string characters


range values allowed except boolean implementation defined functions provided data conversions conversion real integer following functions available round rounds integer using bankers rounding trunc rounds towards zero
programmer freedom define commonly used data types byte string terms predefined types using pascals type declaration facility example


type
byte 0255
signedbyte 128127
string packed array1255 char

oftenused types like byte string already defined many implementations
subrange typesedit
subranges ordinal data type simple type except real also made






typesedit

could also done using statement follows


newnodeptr

nodeptr
begin






inside scope statement refer subfields record pointer nodeptr record node pointer type pnode
linked lists stacks queues created including pointer type field record also
unlike many languages feature pointers pascal allows pointers reference dynamically created variables anonymous allow reference standard static local variables pointers also must associated type pointer type compatible pointer another type pointer char compatible pointer integer helps eliminate type security issues inherent pointer implementations particularly used also removes risks caused dangling pointers ability dynamically deallocate referenced space using dispose function effect free library function found means risk dangling pointers entirely eliminated22 languages java provide automatic garbage collection entirely eliminate related problem memory leaks
restrictions lifted newer dialects
control structuresedit
pascal structured programming language meaning flow control structured standard statements usually without goto commands

procedures functions nest depth program construct logical outermost block
procedure function declarations goto labels constants types variables procedures functions must order ordering requirement originally intended allow efficient singlepass compilation however dialects embarcadero delphi strict ordering requirement declaration sections relaxed
semicolons statement separatorsedit
pascal adopted many language syntax features algol language including semicolon statement separator contrast languages semicolon statement terminator illustrated examples semicolon needed keyword record type declaration block case statement keyword repeat statement else keyword statement
presence extra semicolon permitted early versions pascal however addition algollike empty statements 1973 revised report later changes language 71851983 allow optional semicolons cases semicolon still permitted immediately else keyword statement else follows single statement statement sequence case nested semicolon cannot used avoid dangling else problem inner else outer putatively terminating nested semicolon instead terminates clauses instead explicit beginend block must used23
programmers usually include extra semicolons habit avoid changing last line statement sequence code appended
