determined three ways principle give result production output value added approach income approach expenditure approach
direct three production approach sums outputs every class enterprise arrive total expenditure approach works principle product must bought somebody therefore value total product must equal peoples total expenditures buying things income approach works principle incomes productive factors producers colloquially must equal value product determines finding producers incomes12
production approachedit
approach mirrors oecd definition given

estimate gross value domestic output many various economic activities
determine intermediate consumption cost material supplies services used produce final goods services
deduct intermediate consumption gross value obtain gross value added

gross value added gross value output value intermediate consumption
value output value total sales goods services plus value changes inventory
gross value added various economic activities known factor cost
factor cost plus indirect taxes less subsidies products producer price
measuring output domestic product economic activities industries classified various sectors classifying economic activities output sector calculated following methods

multiplying output sector respective market price adding together
collecting data gross sales inventories records companies adding together

gross value sectors added gross value added factor cost subtracting sectors intermediate consumption gross output gives factor cost adding indirect minus subsidies factor cost gives producer prices

computed income basis


second estimating primary incomes distributed resident producer units2
calculated sometimes called gross domestic income provide amount expenditure method described later definition practice however measurement errors make figures slightly reported national statistical agencies
method measures adding incomes firms households factors production hire wages labour interest capital rent land profits entrepreneurship
national income expenditure accounts divide incomes five categories

wages salaries supplementary labour income
corporate profits
interest miscellaneous investment income
farmers incomes
income nonfarm unincorporated businesses

five income components domestic income factor cost
adjustments must made

indirect taxes minus subsidies added factor cost market prices
depreciation capital consumption allowance added domestic product gross domestic product

total income subdivided according various schemes leading various formulae measured income approach common

compensation employees gross operating surplus gross mixed income taxes less subsidies production imports



compensation employees measures total remuneration employees work done includes wages salaries well employer contributions social security programs
gross operating surplus surplus owners incorporated businesses often called profits although subset total costs subtracted gross output calculate
gross mixed income measure unincorporated businesses often includes small businesses

called total factor income income factors production society measures value factor basic prices difference basic prices final prices used expenditure calculation total taxes subsidies government levied paid production adding taxes less subsidies production imports converts factor cost gdpi
total factor income also sometimes expressed

total factor income employee compensation corporate profits proprietors income rental income interest14

expenditure approachedit
third estimate calculate final uses goods services uses except intermediate consumption measured purchasers prices2
market goods produced purchased someone case good produced unsold standard accounting convention producer bought good therefore measuring total expenditure used things measuring production known expenditure method calculating
components expenditureedit




computed expenditure basis


consumption investment government spending exports



description component

consumption normally largest component economy consisting private expenditures economy household final consumption expenditure personal expenditures fall following categories durable goods nondurable goods services examples include food rent jewelry gasoline medical expenses purchase housing
investment includes instance business investment equipment include exchanges existing assets examples include construction mine purchase software purchase machinery equipment factory spending households government houses also included investment contrast colloquial meaning investment mean purchases financial products buying financial products classed saving opposed investment avoids doublecounting buys shares company company uses money received plant equipment amount counted toward company spends money things also count gives company would count times amount corresponds group products buying bonds stocks swapping deeds transfer claims future production directly expenditure products
government spending government expenditures final goods services includes salaries public servants purchases weapons military investment expenditure government include transfer payments social security unemployment benefits
exports represents gross exports captures amount country produces including goods services produced nations consumption therefore exports added
imports represents gross imports imports subtracted since imported goods included terms must deducted avoid counting foreign supply domestic

note expenditures final goods services expenditures intermediate goods services count intermediate goods services used businesses produce goods services within accounting year15
according bureau economic analysis responsible calculating national accounts united states general source data expenditures components considered reliable income components income method below16

contrasted gross national product known gross national income difference defines scope according location defines scope according ownership global context world world therefore equivalent terms
product produced within countrys borders product produced enterprises owned countrys citizens would productive enterprises country owned citizens citizens productive enterprises countries practice however foreign ownership makes nonidentical production within countrys borders enterprise owned somebody outside country counts part hand production enterprise located outside country owned citizens counts part
example value output produced americanowned firms regardless firms located similarly country becomes increasingly debt spends large amounts income servicing debt reflected decreased decreased similarly country sells resources entities outside country also reflected time decreased decreased would make attractive politicians countries increasing national debt decreasing assets
gross national income equals plus income receipts rest world minus income payments rest world17

nominal adjustments gdpedit
figure given equations called nominal historical current compares figures year another desirable compensate changes value money effects inflation deflation make meaningful yeartoyear comparisons multiplied ratio value money year measured value money base year
example suppose countrys 1990 million 2000 million suppose also inflation halved value currency period meaningfully compare 2000 1990 could multiply 2000 onehalf make relative 1990 base year result would 2000 equals million onehalf million 1990 monetary terms would countrys realistically increased percent period percent might appear data adjusted changes money value called real constant
factor used convert current constant values called deflator unlike consumer price index measures inflation deflation price household consumer goods deflator measures changes prices domestically produced goods services economy including investment goods government services well household consumption goods21
constantgdp figures allow calculate growth rate indicates much countrys production increased decreased growth rate negative compared previous year

real growth rate year real year real year real year

another thing desirable account population growth countrys doubled certain period population tripled increase mean standard living increased countrys residents average person country producing less percapita measure account population growth
crossborder comparison purchasing power parityedit
level different countries compared converting value national currency according either current currency exchange rate purchasing power parity exchange rate

current currency exchange rate exchange rate international foreign exchange market
purchasing power parity exchange rate exchange rate based purchasing power parity currency relative selected standard usually united states dollar comparative theoretical exchange rate directly realize rate sell entire basket country convert cash currency market rate rebuy basket goods country converted cash going country country distribution prices within basket vary typically nontradable purchases consume greater proportion baskets total cost higher country balassasamuelson effect

ranking countries differ significantly based method used

current exchange rate method converts value goods services using global currency exchange rates method offer better indications countrys international purchasing power instance spent buying hitech foreign arms number weapons purchased entirely governed current exchange rates since arms traded product bought international market meaningful local price distinct international price high technology goods method conversion relevant nontraded goods services example hitech weapons produced internally amount governed gdpppp rather nominal

clear pattern purchasing power parity method decreasing disparity high income countries compared current exchange rate method finding called penn effect

standard living wealth distribution externalitiesedit
capita often used indicator living standards22
major advantage capita indicator standard living measured frequently widely consistently measured frequently countries provide information quarterly basis allowing trends seen quickly measured widely measure available almost every country world allowing intercountry comparisons measured consistently technical definition relatively consistent among countries
include several factors influence standard living particular fails account

externalities economic growth entail increase negative externalities directly measured gdp2324 increased industrial output might grow pollution counted25
nonmarket transactions– excludes activities provided market household production bartering goods services volunteer unpaid services
nonmonetary economy– omits economies money comes play resulting inaccurate abnormally figures example countries major business transactions occurring informally portions local economy easily registered bartering prominent money even extending services24
quality improvements inclusion products– fully adjusting quality improvements products understates true economic growth instance although computers today less expensive powerful computers past treats products accounting monetary value introduction products also difficult measure accurately reflected despite fact increase standard living example even richest person 1900 could purchase standard products antibiotics cell phones average consumer today since modern conveniences exist
sustainability growth– measurement economic historic activity necessarily projection
wealth distribution account variances incomes various demographic groups income inequality metrics discussion variety inequalitybased economic measures24

limitations introductionedit
simon kuznets economist developed first comprehensive measures national income stated first report congress 1934 section titled uses abuses national income measurements8

valuable capacity human mind simplify complex situation compact characterization becomes dangerous controlled terms definitely stated criteria quantitative measurements especially definiteness result suggests often misleadingly precision simplicity outlines object measured measurements national income subject type illusion resulting abuse especially since deal matters center conflict opposing social groups effectiveness argument often contingent upon oversimplification


qualifications upon estimates national income index productivity important income measurements interpreted point view economic welfare latter case additional difficulties suggested anyone wants penetrate surface total figures market values economic welfare cannot adequately measured unless personal distribution income known income measurement undertakes estimate reverse side income intensity unpleasantness effort going earning income welfare nation therefore scarcely inferred measurement national income defined

1962 kuznets stated27

distinctions must kept mind quantity quality growth costs returns short long goals growth specify growth

criticismsedit
ever since development multiple observers pointed limitations using overarching measure economic social progress
many environmentalists argue poor measure social progress take account harm environment2829
although high rising level often associated increased economic social progress within country number scholars pointed necessarily play many instances example jean drèze amartya pointed increase growth necessarily lead higher standard living particularly areas healthcare education30 another important area necessarily improve along political liberty notable china growth strong political liberties heavily restricted31
account distribution income among residents country merely aggregate measure economy highly developed growing rapidly also contain wide rich poor society inequalities often occur lines race ethnicity gender religion minority status within countries lead misleading characterizations economic wellbeing income distribution heavily skewed toward high poorer residents directly benefit overall level wealth income generated country even capita measures downside inequality high example south africa apartheid ranked high terms capita benefits immense wealth income shared equally among countrycitation needed
take account value household unpaid work including martha nussbaum argue value included measuring household labor largely substitute goods services would otherwise purchased value32 even conservative estimates value unpaid labor australia calculated countrys gdp33 later study analyzed value countries results ranging canada using conservative estimates high nearly united kingdom using liberal estimates united states value estimated nearly high depending methodology used34 many public policies shaped calculations related field national accounts35 noninclusion unpaid work calculating create distortions public policy economists advocated changes public policies formed implemented36
natural capital committee highlighted shortcomings advice government 2013 pointing focuses flows stocks result economy assets time record high levels growth point reached depleted assets check future growth went apparent recorded growth rate overstates sustainable growth rate broader measures wellbeing wealth needed danger shortterm decisions based solely currently measured national accounts prove costly longterm
proposals overcome limitationsedit
response limitations using alternative approaches emerged

1980s amartya martha nussbaum developed capability approach focuses functional capabilities enjoyed people within country rather aggregate wealth held within country capabilities consist functions person able achieve37
1990 mahbub pakistani economist united nations introduced human development index composite index life expectancy birth adult literacy rate standard living measured logarithmic function adjusted purchasing power parity
1989 john cobb herman daly introduced index sustainable economic welfare isew taking account various factors consumption nonrenewable resources degradation environment formula deducted personal consumption public nondefensive expenditures private defensive expenditures capital formation services domestic labour costs environmental degradation depreciation natural capital
2005 jones american economist international institute management introduced first secular gross national happiness index gross national wellbeing framework index complement economics additional seven dimensions including environment education government work social health mental physical indicators proposal inspired king bhutans philosophy383940
2009 european union released communication titled beyond measuring progress changing world41 identified five actions improve indicators progress ways make responsive concerns citizens introduced proposal complementing environmental social indicators
2009 professors joseph stiglitz amartya jeanpaul fitoussi commission measurement economic performance social progress cmepsp formed french president nicolas sarkozy published proposal overcome limitation economics expand focus wellbeing economics wellbeing framework consisting health environment work physical safety economic safety political freedom
