multimedia edit
digital multimedia bitrate represents amount information detail stored unit time recording bitrate depends several factors

original material sampled different frequencies
samples different numbers bits
data encoded different schemes
information digitally compressed different algorithms different degrees

generally choices made factors order achieve desired tradeoff minimizing bitrate maximizing quality material played
lossy data compression used audio visual data differences original signal introduced compression substantial lossy data decompressed recompressed become noticeable form compression artifacts whether affect perceived quality much depends compression scheme encoder power characteristics input data listener’s perceptions listeners familiarity artifacts listening viewing environment
bitrates section approximately minimum average listener typical listening viewing environment using best available compression would perceive significantly worse reference standard
encoding rate edit
digital multimedia rate often refers number bits used unit playback time represent continuous medium audio video source coding data compression encoding rate multimedia file size multimedia file bytes divided playback time recording seconds multiplied eight
realtime streaming multimedia encoding rate goodput required avoid interrupt

encoding rate required goodput

term average bitrate used case variable bitrate multimedia source coding schemes context peak rate maximum number bits required shortterm block compressed data16
