muhammad jinnahs excerpt


person majority testamentary capacity generally sound mind make without lawyer additional requirements vary depending jurisdiction generally include following requirements

testator must clearly identify maker made commonly called publication typically satisfied words last testament face document
testator declare revokes previous wills codicils otherwise subsequent revokes earlier wills codicils extent inconsistent however subsequent completely inconsistent earlier earlier considered completely revoked implication
testator demonstrate capacity dispose property sound mind freely willingly
testator must sign date usually presence least disinterested witnesses persons beneficiaries extra witnesses called supernumerary witnesses question interestedparty conflict jurisdictions notably pennsylvania long abolished requirement witnesses united states louisiana requires attestation witnesses well notarization notary public holographic handwritten wills generally require witnesses valid
witnesses designated receive property witnesses effect many jurisdictions either disallowing receive invalidating status witness growing number states united states however interested party improper witness clauses benefit instance illinois
testators signature must placed observed text following signature ignored entire invalidated comes signature material ignoring would defeat testators intentions
beneficiaries devisees legatees must generally clearly stated text jurisdictions allow valid merely revokes previous revokes disposition previous names executor

legal requirement drawn lawyer although pitfalls homemade wills fall person makes available explain correct technical deficiency error expression comes effect persons death little room mistake common error example execution homemade wills england beneficiary typically spouse close family members witness effect disinheriting witness regardless provisions
include requirement heir commit illegal immoral public policy condition receipt community property jurisdictions cannot used disinherit surviving spouse entitled least portion testators estate united states children disinherited parents except louisiana minimum share guaranteed surviving children many civil countries follow similar rule england wales 1933 1975 could disinherit spouse since inheritance provision family dependants 1975 attempt defeated court order leaves surviving spouse entitled dependent without reasonable financial provision
international willsedit
1973 international convention convention providing uniform form international will7 concluded context unidroit convention provided universally recognised code rules made anywhere person nationality would valid enforceable every country became party convention known international wills belgium bosniaherzegovina canada provinces quebec cyprus ecuador france italy libya niger portugal slovenia holy iran laos russian federation sierra leone united kingdom united states signed ratified8 international wills valid convention applies although ratified behalf state uniform enacted states district columbiacitation needed
individuals assets multiple countries least countries part convention appropriate person multiple wills country89 nations multiple wills useful reduce avoid taxes upon estate assets10 care must taken avoid accidental revocation prior wills conflicts wills anticipate jurisdictional choice issues arise probate9
revocationedit
methods effectedit
intentional physical destruction testator revoke deliberately burning tearing physical document striking signature jurisdictions partial revocation allowed part text particular provision crossed jurisdictions either ignore attempt hold entire actually revoked testator also able revoke physical another would necessary physically incapacitated done presence presence witnesses jurisdictions presume destroyed last seen possession testator found mutilated cannot found death
also revoked execution wills contain stock language expressly revokes wills came however normally court still attempt read wills together extent consistent
jurisdictions complete revocation automatically revives next recent others hold revocation leaves testator heirs instead inherit intestate succession
england wales marriage automatically revoke presumed upon marriage testator want review statement made contemplation forthcoming marriage named person override
divorce conversely revoke many jurisdictions effect former spouse treated died testator benefit
accidentally destroyed evidence case copy draft admitted probate
dependent relative revocationedit
many jurisdictions exercise equitable doctrine known dependent relative revocation doctrine courts disregard revocation based mistake part testator effect revocation example testator mistakenly believes earlier revived revocation later court ignore later revocation later comes closer fulfilling testators intent doctrine also applies testator executes second revokes mistaken belief would valid however reason valid court apply doctrine reinstate probate court holds testator would prefer intestate succession
applying doctrine courts require rare exceptions alternative plan disposition property revoking prior testator could made alternative plan disposition plan would show testator intended revocation result property going elsewhere rather revoked disposition secondly courts require either testator recited mistake terms revoking instrument mistake established clear convincing evidence example testator made original revocation must erroneously noted revoking gift intended recipient died enact tomorrow
applied restore gift erroneously struck intent testator enlarge gift apply restore gift intent testator revoke gift favor another person example suppose bequeaths 5000 secretary alice johnson crosses clause writes 7000 alice johnson margin sign date writing margin states would find revoked earlier provision effectively amended second however revocation would undone acting mistaken belief could increase gift 7000 writing margin therefore alice 5000 dollars however doctrine relative revocation apply interlineation decreases amount gift original provision 5000 alice johnson crossed replaced 3000 alice johnson without testators signature date margin apply alice johnson take nothing
similarly crosses clause writes margin 5000 betty smith without signing dating writing gift alice effectively revoked case restored doctrine even though mistaken effectiveness gift betty mistake affect toms intent revoke gift alice gift betty invalid lack proper execution 5000 toms residuary estate
election willedit
also referred electing take united states many states probate statutes permit surviving spouse decedent choose receive particular share deceased spouses estate lieu receiving specified share left deceased spouses simple example iowa code iowa section 633238 2005 deceased spouse leaves expressly devises marital home someone surviving spouse surviving spouse elect contrary intent live home remainder hisher lifetime called life estate terminates immediately upon surviving spouses death
historical social policy purposes statutes assure surviving spouse receives statutorily minimum amount property decedent historically statutes enacted prevent deceased spouse leaving survivor destitute thereby shifting burden care social welfare system
york surviving spouse entitled onethird deceased spouses estate decedents debts administrative expenses reasonable funeral expenses paid prior calculation spousal elective share elective share calculated estate estate inclusive property passed laws intestacy testamentary property testamentary substitutes enumerated eptl 511a yorks classification testamentary substitutes included estate make challenging deceased spouse disinherit surviving spouse
