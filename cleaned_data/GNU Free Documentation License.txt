contains statement

technical measures obstruct control reading copying copies make distribute

work quickly encumbered different title must given list previous titles must kept could lead situation whole series title pages dedications every copy book long lineage pages cannot removed work enters public domain copyright expires
richard stallman said invariant sections debianlegal mailing list20

goal invariant sections ever since first made manifesto invariant section emacs manual make sure could removed specifically make sure distributors emacs also distribute nonfree software could remove statements philosophy might think statements criticize actions
