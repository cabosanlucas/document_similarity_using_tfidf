domain name system hierarchical decentralized naming system computers services resources connected internet private network associates various information domain names assigned participating entities prominently translates readily memorized domain names numerical addresses needed locating identifying computer services devices underlying network protocols providing worldwide distributed directory service domain name system essential component functionality internet since 1985
domain name system delegates responsibility assigning domain names mapping names internet resources designating authoritative name servers domain network administrators delegate authority subdomains allocated name space name servers mechanism provides distributed fault tolerant service designed avoid single large central database
domain name system also specifies technical functionality database service core defines protocol detailed specification data structures data communication exchanges used part internet protocol suite historically directory services preceding scalable large global directories originally based text files prominently hosts file

structure edit
domain name spaceedit
domain name space consists tree data structure node leaf tree label zero resource records hold information associated domain name domain name consists label possibly concatenated name parent node right separated dot17 tree subdivides zones beginning root zone zone consist domain consist many domains subdomains depending administrative choices zone manager also partitioned according class separate classes thought array parallel namespace trees18




hierarchical domain name system class internet organized zones served name server


administrative responsibility zone divided creating additional zones authority zone said delegated designated name server parent zone ceases authoritative zone18
domain name syntaxedit
definitive descriptions rules forming domain names appear 1035 1123 2181 domain name consists parts technically called labels conventionally concatenated delimited dots examplecom
rightmost label conveys toplevel domain example domain name wwwexamplecom belongs toplevel domain
hierarchy domains descends right left label left specifies subdivision subdomain domain right example label example specifies subdomain domain subdomain examplecom tree subdivisions levelscitation needed
label contain zero characters null label length zero reserved root zone full domain name exceed length characters textual representation1 internal binary representation maximum length requires octets storage also stores length name3
although domain names theoretically consist character representable octet host names preferred format character characters allowed labels subset ascii character consisting characters digits hyphen rule known rule letters digits hyphen domain names interpreted caseindependent manner19 labels start hyphen20 additional rule requires toplevel domain names allnumeric20
internationalized domain namesedit
limited ascii characters permitted prevented representation names words many languages native alphabets scripts make possible icann approved internationalizing domain names applications idna system user applications browsers unicode strings valid character using punycode 2009 icann approved installation internationalized domain name country code toplevel domains cctlds addition many registries existing level domain names tlds adopted idna system
name serversedit
domain name system maintained distributed database system uses client–server model nodes database name servers domain least authoritative server publishes information domain name servers domains subordinate hierarchy served root name servers servers query looking resolving
authoritative name serveredit
authoritative name server name server gives answers queries data configured original source example domain administrator dynamic methods contrast answers obtained query another name server maintains cache data
authoritative name server either master server slave server master server server stores original master copies zone records slave server uses special automatic updating mechanism protocol communication master maintain identical copy master records
every zone must assigned authoritative name servers servers stored parent domain zone name server records
authoritative server indicates status supplying definitive answers deemed authoritative setting protocol flag called authoritative answer responses3 flag usually reproduced prominently output administration query tools indicate responding name server authority domain name question3

address resolution mechanismedit
domain name resolvers determine domain name servers responsible domain name question sequence queries starting rightmost toplevel domain label




resolver implements iterative approach mandated 1034 case resolver consults three name servers resolve fully qualified domain name wwwwikipediaorg


proper operation domain name resolver network host configured initial cache hints known addresses root name servers hints updated periodically administrator retrieving dataset reliable source
assuming resolver cached records accelerate process resolution process starts query root servers typical operation root servers answer directly respond referral authoritative servers query wwwwikipediaorg referred servers resolver queries servers referred iteratively repeat process receives authoritative answer diagram illustrates process host named fully qualified domain name wwwwikipediaorg
mechanism would place large traffic burden root servers every resolution internet required starting root practice caching used servers offload root servers result root name servers actually involved fraction requests
recursive caching name serveredit
theory authoritative name servers sufficient operation internet however authoritative name servers operating every query must start recursive queries root zone domain name system user system would implement resolver software capable recursive operation
improve efficiency reduce traffic across internet increase performance enduser applications domain name system supports cache servers store query results period time determined configuration timetolive domain name record question typically caching servers also implement recursive algorithm necessary resolve given name starting root authoritative name servers queried domain function implemented name server user applications gain efficiency design operation
combination caching recursive functions name server mandatory functions implemented independently servers special purposes
internet service providers typically provide recursive caching name servers customers addition many home networking routers implement caches recursors improve efficiency local network
resolversedit
client side called resolver resolver responsible initiating sequencing queries ultimately lead full resolution translation resource sought translation domain name address individual query either nonrecursive recursive iterative combination these1

nonrecursive query method resolver client queries server provides record domain authoritative provides partial result without querying servers case caching resolver nonrecursive query local cache delivers result reduces load upstream servers caching request records period time initial response upstream servers
recursive query approach resolver client query single server query client servers behalf requester example simple stub resolver running home router typically make recursive query server users recursive query server fully answer query give error querying name servers needed typical operation client issue recursive query caching recursive server issue nonrecursive queries determine answer send single answer back client resolver another server acting recursively behalf resolver negotiates recursive service using bits query headers servers required support recursive queries
iterative query procedure resolver client query chain servers server refer client next server chain current server fully resolve request example possible resolution wwwexamplecom would query global root server server finally examplecom server

circular dependencies glue recordsedit
name servers delegations identified name rather address means resolving name server must issue another request find address server referred name given delegation subdomain domain delegation provided circular dependency
case name server providing delegation must also provide addresses authoritative name server mentioned delegation information called glue delegating name server provides glue form records additional section response provides delegation authority section response glue record combination name server address
example authoritative name server exampleorg ns1exampleorg computer trying resolve wwwexampleorg first resolves ns1exampleorg contained exampleorg requires resolving exampleorg first presents circular dependency break dependency name server level domain includes glue along delegation exampleorg glue records address records provide addresses ns1exampleorg resolver uses addresses query domains authoritative servers allows complete query
record cachingedit
standard practice implementing name resolution applications reduce load domain name system servers caching results locally intermediate resolver hosts results obtained request always associated time live expiration time results must discarded refreshed administrator authoritative server period validity vary seconds days even weeks
result distributed caching architecture changes records propagate throughout network immediately require caches expire refreshed 1912 conveys basic rules determining appropriate values
resolvers override values protocol supports caching years caching negative caching caching fact nonexistence record determined name servers authoritative zone must include start authority record reporting data requested type exists value minimum field record used establish negative answer
reverse lookupedit
main article reverse lookup
reverse lookup query domain names address known multiple domain names associated address stores addresses form domain names specially formatted names pointer records within infrastructure toplevel domain arpa ipv4 domain inaddrarpa ipv6 reverse lookup domain ip6arpa address represented name reverseordered octet representation ipv4 reverseordered nibble representation ipv6
performing reverse lookup client converts address formats querying name record following delegation chain query example assuming ipv4 address 208801522 assigned wikimedia represented name reverse order 215280208inaddrarpa resolver gets pointer request begins querying root servers point servers american registry internet numbers arin 208inaddrarpa zone arins servers delegate 15280208inaddrarpa wikimedia resolver sends another query 215280208inaddrarpa results authoritative response
client lookupedit




resolution sequence


users generally communicate directly resolver instead resolution takes place transparently applications browsers email clients internet applications application makes request requires domain name lookup programs send resolution request resolver local operating system turn handles communications required
resolver almost invariably cache containing recent lookups cache provide answer request resolver return value cache program made request cache contain answer resolver send request designated servers case home users internet service provider machine connects usually supply server user either configured servers address manually allowed dhcp however systems administrators configured systems servers resolvers point separately maintained name servers organization event name server thus queried follow process outlined either successfully finds result returns results resolver assuming found result resolver duly caches result future hands result back software initiated request
broken resolversedit
large isps configured servers violate rules disobeying ttls indicating domain name exist name servers respond21
applications browsers maintain internal cache avoid repeated lookups network practice extra difficulty debugging issues obscures history data caches typically short caching times order minute22
internet explorer represents notable exception versions cache records hours default internet explorer later versions decrease default time value half hour changed modifying default configuration23
google chrome triggers specific error message issues server broken google chrome returns error message24
applicationsedit
domain name system includes several functions features
hostnames addresses required match onetoone relationship multiple hostnames correspond single address useful virtual hosting many sites served single host alternatively single hostname resolve many addresses facilitate fault tolerance load distribution multiple server instances across enterprise global internet
serves purposes addition translating names addresses instance mail transfer agents find best mail server deliver email record provides mapping domain mail exchanger provide additional layer fault tolerance load distribution
used efficient storage distribution addresses blacklisted email hosts common method place address subject host subdomain higher level domain name resolve name record indicates positive negative indication
example

address 102345 blacklisted points 543102blacklistexample resolves 127001
address 102346 blacklisted points 643102blacklistexample hostname either configured resolves 127002

email servers query blacklistexample find specific host connecting blacklist many blacklists either subscriptionbased free cost available email administrators antispam software
sender policy framework domainkeys designed take advantage another record type record since assigned specific record types
provide resilience event computer network failure multiple servers usually provided coverage domain level global thirteen groups root name servers exist additional copies distributed worldwide anycast addressing
dynamic ddns updates server client address onthefly example moving isps mobile spots address changes administratively
message formatedit
protocol uses types messages queries replies format message consists header four sections question answer authority additional space header field flags controls content four sections1
header section contains following fields identification flags number questions number answers number authority resource records number additional identification field used match responses queries flag field consists several subfields first single indicates message query reply second subfield consists four bits value present packet reply present packet status value present packet request singlebit subfield indicates server authoritative queried hostname another singlebit subfield indicates client wants send recursive query next singlebit subfield indicates replying server supports recursion servers configured task another subfield indicates request truncated reason fourbit subfield indicates status question section contains domain name type record aaaa resolved domain name broken discrete labels concatenated label prefixed length label answer section resource records queried name domain name occur multiple records multiple addresses associated25

several vulnerability issues discovered exploited malicious users issue cache poisoning data distributed caching resolvers pretense authoritative origin server thereby polluting data store potentially false information long expiration times timetolive subsequently legitimate application requests redirected network hosts operated malicious intent
responses traditionally cryptographic signature leading many attack possibilities domain name system security extensions dnssec modify support cryptographically signed responses dnscurve proposed alternative dnssec extensions tsig support cryptographic authentication trusted peers commonly used authorize zone transfer dynamic update operations
domain names used achieve spoofing effects example paypalcom paypa1com different names users unable distinguish graphical user interface depending users chosen typeface many fonts letter numeral look similar even identical problem acute systems support internationalized domain names many character codes 10646 appear identical typical computer screens vulnerability occasionally exploited phishing29
