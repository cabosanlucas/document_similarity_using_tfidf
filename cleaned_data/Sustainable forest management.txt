independent certificationedit
main article certified wood
growing environmental awareness consumer demand socially responsible businesses helped thirdparty forest certification emerge 1990s credible tool communicating environmental social performance forest operations
many potential users certification including forest managers scientists policy makers investors environmental advocates business consumers wood paper individuals
thirdparty forest certification independent organization develops standards good forest management independent auditors issue certificates forest operations comply standards forest certification verifies forests wellmanaged defined particular standard chainofcustody certification tracks wood paper products certified forest processing point sale
rise certification emergence several different systems throughout world result single accepted forest management standard worldwide system takes somewhat different approach defining standards sustainable forest management
2009–2010 forest products annual market review united nations economic commission europefood agriculture organization stated years many issues previously divided certification systems become much less distinct largest certification systems generally structural programmatic requirements24
thirdparty forest certification important tool seeking ensure paper wood products purchase come forests wellmanaged legally harvested incorporating thirdparty certification forest product procurement practices centerpiece comprehensive wood paper policies include factors protection sensitive forest values thoughtful material selection efficient products25
