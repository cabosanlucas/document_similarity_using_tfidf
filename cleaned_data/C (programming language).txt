overview
like imperative languages algol tradition facilities structured programming allows lexical variable scope recursion static type system prevents many unintended operations executable code contained within subroutines called functions although strict sense functional programming function parameters always passed value passbyreference simulated explicitly passing pointer values program source text freeformat using semicolon statement terminator curly braces grouping blocks statements
language also exhibits following characteristics

small fixed number keywords including full flow control primitives ifelse switch dowhile userdefined names distinguished keywords kind sigil
large number arithmetical logical operators
assignment performed single statement
function return values ignored needed
typing static weakly enforced data type implicit conversions performed
declaration syntax mimics usage context define keyword instead statement beginning name type taken declaration function keyword instead function indicated parentheses argument list
userdefined typedef compound types possible

heterogeneous aggregate data types struct allow related data elements accessed assigned unit
array indexing secondary notation defined terms pointer arithmetic unlike structs arrays firstclass objects cannot assigned compared using single builtin operators array keyword definition instead square brackets indicate arrays syntactically example month11
enumerated types possible enum keyword tagged freely interconvertible integers
strings separate data type conventionally implemented nullterminated arrays characters


lowlevel access computer memory possible converting machine addresses typed pointers
procedures subroutines returning values special case function untyped return type void
functions defined within lexical scope functions
function data pointers permit runtime polymorphism
preprocessor performs macro definition source code file inclusion conditional compilation
basic form modularity files compiled separately linked together control functions data objects visible files static extern attributes
complex functionality string manipulation mathematical functions consistently delegated library routines

include features found languages object orientation garbage collection features implemented emulated often external libraries boehm garbage collector glib object system
relations languages
many later languages borrowed directly indirectly including rust java javascript limbo objectivec perl python swift verilog hardware description language5 unixs shell languages drawn many control structures basic features python dramatic exception also syntactically similar general tend combine recognizable expression statement syntax underlying type systems data models semantics radically different
history
early developments




thompson left dennis ritchie right inventor programming language


origin closely tied development unix operating system originally implemented assembly language pdp7 dennis ritchie thompson incorporating several ideas colleagues eventually decided port operating system pdp11 original pdp11 version unix developed assembly language developers considering rewriting system using language thompsons simplified version bcpl10 however inability take advantage pdp11s features notably byte addressability name chosen simply next
development started 1972 pdp11 unix system12 first appeared version unix13 language initially designed portability mind soon different platforms well compiler honeywell 6000 written within first year history system370 port followed soon112
also 1972 large part unix rewritten 1973 addition struct types language become powerful enough unix kernel
unix first operating system kernels implemented language assembly earlier instances include multics system written master control program burroughs b5000 written algol 1961 around 1977 ritchie stephen johnson made changes language facilitate portability unix operating system johnsons portable compiler served basis several implementations platforms12





cover book programming language first edition brian kernighan dennis ritchie


1978 brian kernighan dennis ritchie published first edition programming language1 book known programmers served many years informal specification language version describes commonly referred second edition book15 covers later ansi standard described
introduced several language features

standard library
long data type
unsigned data type
compound assignment operators form changed form remove semantic ambiguity created constructs interpreted decrement instead possibly intended

even publication 1989 ansi standard many years still considered lowest common denominator programmers restricted maximum portability desired since many older compilers still carefully written code legal standard well
early versions functions return types must declared used function definition functions used without prior declaration presumed return type
example


long somefunction
otherfunction

callingfunction

long test1
register test2

test1 somefunction
test1
test2
else
test2 otherfunction
return test2


type specifiers commented could omitted required later standards
since function declarations include information function arguments function parameter type checks performed although compilers would issue warning message local function called wrong number arguments multiple calls external function used different numbers types arguments separate tools unixs lint utility developed among things could check consistency function across multiple source files
years following publication several features added language supported compilers particular pcc16 vendors included

void functions functions return value
functions returning struct union types rather pointers
assignment struct data types
enumerated types

large number extensions lack agreement standard library together language popularity fact even unix compilers precisely implemented specification necessity standardization
ansi
main article ansi
late 1970s 1980s versions implemented wide variety mainframe computers minicomputers microcomputers including popularity began increase significantly
1983 american national standards institute ansi formed committee x3j11 establish standard specification x3j11 based standard unix implementation however nonportable portion unix library handed ieee working group 1003 become basis 1988 posix standard 1989 standard ratified ansi x31591989 programming language version language often referred ansi standard sometimes
1990 ansi standard formatting changes adopted international organization standardization isoiec 98991990 sometimes called therefore terms refer programming language
ansi like national standards bodies longer develops standard independently defers international standard maintained working group isoiec jtc1sc22wg14 national adoption update international standard typically occurs within year publication
aims standardization process produce superset incorporating many subsequently introduced unofficial features standards committee also included several additional features function prototypes borrowed void pointers support international character sets locales preprocessor enhancements although syntax parameter declarations augmented include style used interface continued permitted compatibility existing source code
supported current compilers code written today based program written standard without hardwaredependent assumptions correctly platform conforming implementation within resource limits without precautions programs compile certain platform particular compiler example nonstandard libraries libraries reliance compiler platformspecific attributes exact size data types byte endianness
cases code must compilable either standardconforming cbased compilers stdc macro used split code standard sections prevent cbased compiler features available standard
ansiiso standardization process language specification remained relatively static several years 1995 normative amendment 1990 standard isoiec 9899amd11995 known informally published correct details extensive support international character setscitation needed

main article
standard revised late 1990s leading publication isoiec 98991999 1999 commonly referred since amended three times technical corrigenda17
introduced several features including inline functions several data types including long long complex type represent complex numbers variablelength arrays flexible array members improved support ieee floating point support variadic macros macros variable arity support oneline comments beginning bcpl many already implemented extensions several compilers
part backward compatible stricter ways particular declaration lacks type specifier longer implicitly assumed standard macro stdcversion defined value 199901l indicate support available solaris studio compilers support many features compiler microsoft visual however implements standard parts required compatibility c1118

main article standard revision
2007 work began another revision standard informally called official publication 20111208 standards committee adopted guidelines limit adoption features tested existing implementations
standard adds numerous features library including type generic macros anonymous structures improved unicode support atomic operations multithreading boundschecked functions also makes portions existing library optional improves compatibility standard macro stdcversion defined 201112l indicate support available
embedded
main article embedded
historically embedded programming requires nonstandard extensions language order support exotic features fixedpoint arithmetic multiple distinct memory banks basic operations
2008 standards committee published technical report extending language19 address issues providing common standard implementations adhere includes number features available normal fixedpoint arithmetic named address spaces basic hardware addressing
syntax
main article syntax
formal grammar specified standard20 line endings generally significant however line boundaries significance preprocessing phase comments appear either delimiters since following line comments delimited nest sequences characters interpreted comment delimiters appear inside string character literals21
source files contain declarations function definitions function definitions turn contain declarations statements declarations either define types using keywords struct union enum assign types perhaps reserve storage variables usually writing type followed variable name keywords char specify builtin types sections code enclosed braces sometimes called curly brackets limit scope declarations single statement control structures
imperative language uses statements specify actions common statement expression statement consisting expression evaluated followed semicolon side effect evaluation functions called variables assigned values modify normal sequential execution statements provides several controlflow statements identified reserved keywords structured programming supported ifelse conditional execution dowhile iterative execution looping statement separate initialization testing reinitialization expressions omitted break continue used leave innermost enclosing loop statement skip reinitialization also nonstructured goto statement branches directly designated label within function switch selects case executed based value integer expression
expressions variety builtin operators contain function calls order arguments functions operands operators evaluated unspecified evaluations even interleaved however side effects including storage variables occur next sequence point sequence points include expression statement entry return function call sequence points also occur evaluation expressions containing certain operators comma operator permits high degree object code optimization compiler requires programmers take care obtain reliable results needed programming languages
kernighan ritchie introduction programming language like language blemishes operators wrong precedence parts syntax could better22 standard attempt correct many blemishes impact changes already existing software
character
basic source character includes following characters

lowercase uppercase letters basic latin alphabet
decimal digits
graphic characters
whitespace characters space horizontal vertical form feed newline

newline indicates text line need correspond actual single character although convenience treats
additional multibyte encoded characters used string literals entirely portable latest standard allows multinational unicode characters embedded portably within source text using uxxxx uxxxxxxxx encoding denotes hexadecimal character although feature widely implemented
basic execution character contains characters along representations alert backspace carriage return runtime support extended character sets increased revision standard
reserved words
reserved words also known keywords words cannot used purposes predefined

recently reserved words begin underscore followed capital letter identifiers form previously reserved standard implementations since existing program source code using identifiers would affected implementations started supporting extensions programming language standard headers define convenient synonyms underscored identifiers language previously included reserved word called entry seldom implemented removed reserved word24
operators
main article operators
supports rich operators symbols used within expression specify manipulations performed evaluating expression operators

bitwise logic
bitwise shifts
boolean logic
conditional evaluation

type system static weakly typed makes similar type system algol descendants pascal29 builtin types integers various sizes signed unsigned floatingpoint numbers enumerated types enum integer type char often used singlebyte characters added boolean datatype also derived types including arrays pointers records struct untagged unions union
often used lowlevel systems programming escapes type system necessary compiler attempts ensure type correctness expressions programmer override checks various ways either using type cast explicitly convert value type another using pointers unions reinterpret underlying bits data object
find declaration syntax unintuitive particularly function pointers ritchies idea declare identifiers contexts resembling declaration reflects use30
usual arithmetic conversions allow efficient code generated sometimes produce unexpected results example comparison signed unsigned integers equal width requires conversion signed value unsigned generate unexpected results signed value negative
pointers
supports pointers type reference records address location object function memory pointers dereferenced access data stored address pointed invoke pointedto function pointers manipulated using assignment pointer arithmetic runtime representation pointer value typically memory address perhaps augmented offsetwithinword field since pointers type includes type thing pointed expressions including pointers typechecked compile time pointer arithmetic automatically scaled size pointedto data type pointers used many purposes text strings commonly manipulated using pointers arrays characters dynamic memory allocation performed using pointers many data types trees commonly implemented dynamically allocated struct objects linked together using pointers pointers functions useful passing functions arguments higherorder functions qsort bsearch callbacks invoked event handlers28
null pointer value explicitly points valid location dereferencing null pointer value undefined often resulting segmentation fault null pointer values useful indicating special cases next pointer final node linked list error indication functions returning pointers appropriate contexts source code assigning pointer variable null pointer constant written without explicit casting pointer type null macro defined several standard headers conditional contexts null pointer values evaluate false pointer values evaluate true
void pointers void point objects unspecified type therefore used generic data pointers since size type pointedto object known void pointers cannot dereferenced pointer arithmetic allowed although easily many contexts implicitly converted object pointer type28
careless pointers potentially dangerous typically unchecked pointer variable made point arbitrary location cause undesirable effects although properly used pointers point safe places made point unsafe places using invalid pointer arithmetic objects point continue used deallocation dangling pointers used without initialized wild pointers directly assigned unsafe value using cast union another corrupt pointer general permissive allowing manipulation conversion pointer types although compilers typically provide options various levels checking programming languages address problems using restrictive reference types
arrays
also string
array types traditionally fixed static size specified compile time recent standard also allows form variablelength arrays however also possible allocate block memory arbitrary size runtime using standard librarys malloc function treat array unification arrays pointers means declared arrays dynamically allocated simulated arrays virtually interchangeable
since arrays always accessed effect pointers array accesses typically checked underlying array size although compilers provide bounds checking option31 array bounds violations therefore possible rather common carelessly written code lead various repercussions including illegal memory accesses corruption data buffer overruns runtime exceptions bounds checking desired must done manually
special provision declaring multidimensional arrays rather relies recursion within type system declare arrays arrays effectively accomplishes thing index values resulting multidimensional array thought increasing rowmajor order
multidimensional arrays commonly used numerical algorithms mainly applied linear algebra store matrices structure array well suited particular task however since arrays passed merely pointers bounds array must known fixed values else explicitly passed subroutine requires dynamically sized arrays arrays cannot accessed using double indexing workaround allocate array additional vector pointers columns
introduced variablelength arrays address issues ordinary arrays
array–pointer interchangeability
subscript notation designates pointer syntactic sugar xi32 taking advantage compilers knowledge pointer type address points base address pointed incremented bytes rather defined base address incremented multiplied size element points thus designates i1th element array
furthermore expression contexts notable exception operand sizeof name array automatically converted pointer arrays first element implies array never copied whole named argument function rather address first element passed therefore although function calls passbyvalue semantics arrays effect passed reference
size element determined applying operator sizeof dereferenced element sizeof sizeof number elements declared array determined sizeof sizeof latter applies array names variables declared subscripts semantics possible determine entire size arrays pointers arrays created dynamic allocation malloc code sizeof sizeof arr0 designates pointer work since compiler assumes size pointer requested3334 since array name arguments sizeof converted pointers exhibit ambiguity however arrays created dynamic allocation accessed pointers rather true array variables suffer sizeof issues array pointers
thus despite apparent equivalence array pointer variables still distinction made even though name array expression contexts converted pointer first element pointer occupy storage array name lvalue address constant unlike pointer variable consequently array points cannot changed impossible assign address array name array contents copied however using memcpy function accessing individual elements
memory management
important functions programming language provide facilities managing memory objects stored memory provides three distinct ways allocate memory objects28

static memory allocation space object provided binary compiletime objects extent lifetime long binary contains loaded memory
automatic memory allocation temporary objects stored stack space automatically freed reusable block declared exited
dynamic memory allocation blocks memory arbitrary size requested runtime using library functions malloc region memory called heap blocks persist subsequently freed reuse calling library function realloc free

three approaches appropriate different situations various tradeoffs example static memory allocation little allocation overhead automatic allocation involve slightly overhead dynamic memory allocation potentially great deal overhead allocation deallocation persistent nature static objects useful maintaining state information across function calls automatic allocation easy stack space typically much limited transient either static memory heap space dynamic memory allocation allows convenient allocation objects whose size known runtime programs make extensive three
possible automatic static allocation usually simplest storage managed compiler freeing programmer potentially errorprone chore manually allocating releasing storage however many data structures change size runtime since static allocations automatic allocations must fixed size compiletime many situations dynamic allocation necessary28 prior standard variablesized arrays common example article malloc example dynamically allocated arrays unlike automatic allocation fail time uncontrolled consequences dynamic allocation functions return indication form null pointer value required storage cannot allocated static allocation large usually detected linker loader program even begin execution
unless otherwise specified static objects contain zero null pointer values upon program startup automatically dynamically allocated objects initialized initial value explicitly specified otherwise initially indeterminate values typically whatever pattern happens present storage might even represent valid value type program attempts access uninitialized value results undefined many modern compilers detect warn problem false positives false negatives occur
another issue heap memory allocation synchronized actual usage program order reused much possible example pointer heap memory allocation goes scope value overwritten free called memory cannot recovered later reuse essentially lost program phenomenon known memory leak conversely possible memory freed continue referenced leading unpredictable results typically symptoms appear portion program removed actual error making difficult track problem issues ameliorated languages automatic garbage collection
libraries
programming language uses libraries primary method extension library functions contained within single archive file library typically header file contains prototypes functions contained within library used program declarations special data types macro symbols used functions order program library must include librarys header file library must linked program many cases requires compiler flags shorthand link math library28
common library standard library specified ansi standards comes every implementation implementations target limited environments embedded systems provide subset standard library library supports stream input output memory allocation mathematics character strings time values several separate standard headers example stdioh specify interfaces standard library facilities
another common library functions used applications specifically targeted unix unixlike systems especially functions provide interface kernel functions detailed various standards posix single unix specification
since many programs written wide variety libraries available libraries often written compilers generate efficient object code programmers create interfaces library routines used higherlevel languages like java perl python28
