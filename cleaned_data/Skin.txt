mammalian skin composed primary layers

epidermis provides waterproofing serves barrier infection
dermis serves location appendages skin

epidermisedit
main article epidermis
epidermis composed outermost layers skin forms protective barrier bodys surface responsible keeping water body preventing pathogens entering stratified squamous epithelium9 composed proliferating basal differentiated suprabasal keratinocytes
keratinocytes major cells constituting epidermis9 merkel cells melanocytes langerhans cells also present epidermis subdivided following strata layers beginning outermost layer10

stratum corneum
stratum lucidum palms soles
stratum granulosum
stratum spinosum
stratum germinativum also called stratum basale

keratinocytes stratum basale proliferate mitosis daughter cells move strata changing shape composition undergo multiple stages cell differentiation eventually become anucleated process keratinocytes become highly organized forming cellular junctions desmosomes secreting keratin proteins lipids contribute formation extracellular matrix provide mechanical strength skin11 keratinocytes stratum corneum eventually shed surface desquamation
epidermis contains blood vessels cells deepest layers nourished diffusion blood capillaries extending upper layers dermis
basement membraneedit
main article basement membrane
epidermis dermis separated thin sheet fibers called basement membrane made action tissues basement membrane controls traffic cells molecules dermis epidermis also serves binding variety cytokines growth factors reservoir controlled release physiological remodeling repair processes12
dermisedit
main article dermis
dermis layer skin beneath epidermis consists connective tissue cushions body stress strain dermis provides tensile strength elasticity skin extracellular matrix composed collagen fibrils microfibrils elastic fibers embedded hyaluronan proteoglycans11 skin proteoglycans varied specific locations13 example hyaluronan versican decorin present throughout dermis epidermis extracellular matrix whereas biglycan perlecan found epidermis
harbors many mechanoreceptors nerve endings provide sense touch heat nociceptors thermoreceptors also contains hair follicles sweat glands sebaceous glands apocrine glands lymphatic vessels blood vessels blood vessels dermis provide nourishment waste removal cells well epidermis
dermis tightly connected epidermis basement membrane structurally divided areas superficial area adjacent epidermis called papillary region deep thicker area known reticular region
papillary regionedit
papillary region composed loose areolar connective tissuethis named fingerlike projections called papillae extend toward epidermis papillae provide dermis bumpy surface interdigitates epidermis strengthening connection layers skin
reticular regionedit
reticular region lies deep papillary region usually much thicker composed dense irregular connective tissue receives name dense concentration collagenous elastic reticular fibers weave throughout protein fibers give dermis properties strength extensibility elasticity also located within reticular region roots hair sweat glandssebaceous glands receptors nails blood vessels
subcutaneous tissueedit
main article subcutaneous tissue
subcutaneous tissue also hypodermis part skin lies dermis purpose attach skin underlying bone muscle well supplying blood vessels nerves consists loose connective tissue elastin main cell types fibroblasts macrophages adipocytes subcutaneous tissue contains body serves padding insulation body
microorganisms like staphylococcus epidermidis colonize skin surface density skin flora depends region skin disinfected skin surface gets recolonized bacteria residing deeper areas hair follicle urogenital openings

fishedit
also fish scales
epidermis fish amphibians consists entirely live cells minimal quantities keratin cells superficial layer generally permeable case many amphibians actually major respiratory organ dermis bony fish typically contains relatively little connective tissue found tetrapods instead species largely replaced solid protective bony scales apart particularly large dermal bones form parts skull scales lost tetrapods although many reptiles scales different kind pangolins cartilaginous fish numerous toothlike denticles embedded skin place true scales
sweat glands sebaceous glands unique mammals types skin gland found vertebrates fish typically numerous individual mucussecreting skin cells insulation protection also poison glands photophores cells produce watery serous fluid amphibians mucus cells gathered together form saclike glands living amphibians also possess granular glands skin secrete irritating toxic compounds14
although melanin found skin many species reptiles amphibians fish epidermis often relatively colourless instead colour skin largely chromatophores dermis addition melanin contain guanine carotenoid pigments many species chameleons flounders able change colour skin adjusting relative size chromatophores14
amphibiansedit
also amphibians
overviewedit
amphibians possess types glands mucous granular serous glands part integument thus considered cutaneous mucous granular glands divided three different sections connect structure gland whole three individual parts gland duct intercalary region lastly alveolar gland structurally duct derived keratinocytes passes surface epidermal outer skin layer thus allowing external secretions body gland alveolus shaped structure found bottom base region granular gland cells specialize secretion alveolar gland duct intercalary system summed transitional region connecting duct grand alveolar beneath epidermal skin layer general granular glands larger size mucous glands however mucous glands hold much greater majority overall number15

granular glandsedit
granular glands identified venomous often differ type toxin well concentrations secretions across various orders species within amphibians located clusters differing concentration depending amphibian taxa toxins fatal vertebrates effect others glands alveolar meaning structurally little sacs venom produced held secreted upon defensive behaviors15
structurally ducts granular gland initially maintain cylindrical shape however ducts become mature full toxic fluid base ducts become swollen pressure inside causes epidermal layer form like opening surface duct inner fluid secreted upwards fashion16
intercalary region granular glands developed mature comparison mucous glands region resides ring cells surrounding basal portion duct argued ectodermal muscular nature influence lumen space inside tube duct dilation constriction functions secretions cells found radially around duct provide distinct attachment site muscle fibers around glands body16
gland alveolus divided three specific regionslayers outer layer tunica fibrosa composed densely packed connectivetissue connects fibers spongy intermediate layer elastic fibers well nerves reside nerves send signals muscles well epithelial layers lastly epithelium tunica propria encloses gland16
mucous glandsedit
mucous glands nonvenomous offer different functionality amphibians granular mucous glands cover entire surface area amphibian body specialize keeping body lubricated many functions mucous glands controlling thermoregulation adhesive properties environment antipredator behaviors slimy grasp chemical communication even antibacterialviral properties protection pathogens15
ducts mucous gland appear cylindrical vertical tubes break epidermal layer surface skin cells lining inside ducts oriented longitudinal axis forming degree angles surrounding duct helical fashion16
intercalary cells react identically granular glands smaller scale among amphibians taxa contain modified intercalary region depending function glands majority share structure16
alveolor mucous glands much simple consist epithelium layer well connective tissue forms cover gland gland lacks tunica propria appears delicate intricate fibers pass glands muscle epithelial layers16
birds reptilesedit
main article reptile scales
epidermis birds reptiles closer mammals layer dead keratinfilled cells surface help reduce water loss similar pattern also seen terrestrial amphibians toads however animals clear differentiation epidermis distinct layers occurs humans change cell type relatively gradual mammalian epidermis always possesses least stratum germinativum stratum corneum intermediate layers found humans always distinguishable hair distinctive feature mammalian skin feathers least among living species similarly unique birds14
