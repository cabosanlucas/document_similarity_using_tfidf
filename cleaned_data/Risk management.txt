suggested risk analysis merged article discuss proposed since november 2016



risk management identification evaluation prioritization risks defined 31000 effect uncertainty objectives followed coordinated economical application resources minimize monitor control probability impact unfortunate events1 maximize realization opportunities risk management’s objective assure uncertainty deflect endeavor business goals2
risks come various sources including uncertainty financial markets threats project failures phase design development production sustainment lifecycles legal liabilities credit risk accidents natural causes disasters deliberate attack adversary events uncertain unpredictable rootcause types events negative events classified risks positive events classified opportunities several risk management standards developed including project management institute national institute standards technology actuarial societies standards34 methods definitions goals vary widely according whether risk management method context project management security engineering industrial processes financial portfolios actuarial assessments public health safety
strategies manage threats uncertainties negative consequences typically include avoiding threat reducing negative effect probability threat transferring part threat another party even retaining potential actual consequences particular threat opposites opportunities uncertain future states benefits
certain aspects many risk management standards come criticism measurable improvement risk whereas confidence estimates decisions seem increase1 example study found projects black swans gigantic overruns cost overruns averaged schedule overruns

introductionedit
widely used vocabulary risk management defined guide 732009 risk management vocabulary3
ideal risk management prioritization process followed whereby risks greatest loss impact greatest probability occurring handled first risks lower probability occurrence lower loss handled descending order practice process assessing overall risk difficult balancing resources used mitigate risks high probability occurrence lower loss versus risk high loss lower probability occurrence often mishandled
intangible risk management identifies type risk probability occurring ignored organization lack identification ability example deficient knowledge applied situation knowledge risk materializes relationship risk appears ineffective collaboration occurs processengagement risk issue ineffective operational procedures applied risks directly reduce productivity knowledge workers decrease costeffectiveness profitability service quality reputation brand value earnings quality intangible risk management allows risk management create immediate value identification reduction risks reduce productivity
risk management also faces difficulties allocating resources idea opportunity cost resources spent risk management could spent profitable activities ideal risk management minimizes spending manpower resources also minimizes negative effects risks
according definition risk risk possibility event occur adversely affect achievement objective therefore risk uncertainty risk management coso help managers good control risk company different internal control components leads different outcomes example framework components includes internal environment objective setting event identification risk assessment risk response control activities information communication monitoring
methodedit
part methods consist following elements performed less following order

identify characterize threats
assess vulnerability critical assets specific threats
determine risk expected likelihood consequences specific types attacks specific assets
identify ways reduce risks
prioritize risk reduction measures

principlesedit
international organization standardization identifies following principles risk management6
risk management

create value resources expended mitigate risk less consequence inaction
integral part organizational processes
part decision making process
explicitly address uncertainty assumptions
systematic structured process
based best available information
tailorable
take human factors account
transparent inclusive
dynamic iterative responsive change
capable continual improvement enhancement
continually periodically reassessed

processedit
according standard 31000 risk management principles guidelines implementation4 process risk management consists several steps follows
establishing contextedit
involves

identification risk selected domain interest
planning remainder process
mapping following

social scope risk management
identity objectives stakeholders
basis upon risks evaluated constraints


defining framework activity agenda identification
developing analysis risks involved process
mitigation solution risks using available technological human organizational resources

identificationedit
establishing context next step process managing risk identify potential risks risks events triggered cause problems benefits hence risk identification start source problems competitors benefit problem

source analysiscitation needed risk sources internal external system target risk management mitigation instead management since definition risk deals factors decisionmaking cannot managed

examples risk sources stakeholders project employees company weather airport

problem analysiscitation needed risks related identified threats example threat losing money threat abuse confidential information threat human errors accidents casualties threats exist various entities important shareholders customers legislative bodies government

either source problem known events source trigger events lead problem investigated example stakeholders withdrawing project endanger funding project confidential information stolen employees even within closed network lightning striking aircraft takeoff make people board immediate casualties
chosen method identifying risks depend culture industry practice compliance identification methods formed templates development templates identifying source problem event common risk identification methods

objectivesbased risk identificationcitation needed organizations project teams objectives event endanger achieving objective partly completely identified risk
scenariobased risk identification scenario analysis different scenarios created scenarios alternative ways achieve objective analysis interaction forces example market battle event triggers undesired scenario alternative identified risk futures studies methodology used futurists
taxonomybased risk identification taxonomy taxonomybased risk identification breakdown possible risk sources based taxonomy knowledge best practices questionnaire compiled answers questions reveal risks7
commonrisk checkingcitation needed several industries lists known risks available risk list checked application particular situation8
risk charting method combines approaches listing resources risk threats resources modifying factors increase decrease risk consequences wished avoid creating matrix headings enables variety approaches begin resources consider threats exposed consequences alternatively start threats examine resources would affect begin consequences determine combination threats resources would involved bring

assessmentedit
main article risk assessment
risks identified must assessed potential severity impact generally negative impact damage loss probability occurrence quantities either simple measure case value lost building impossible know sure case unlikely event probability occurrence unknown therefore assessment process critical make best educated decisions order properly prioritize implementation risk management plan
even shortterm positive improvement longterm negative impacts take turnpike example highway widened allow traffic traffic capacity leads greater development areas surrounding improved traffic capacity time traffic thereby increases fill available capacity turnpikes thereby need expanded seemingly endless cycles many engineering examples expanded capacity function soon filled increased demand since expansion comes cost resulting growth could become unsustainable without forecasting management
fundamental difficulty risk assessment determining rate occurrence since statistical information available kinds past incidents particularly scanty case catastrophic events simply infrequency furthermore evaluating severity consequences impact often quite difficult intangible assets asset valuation another question needs addressed thus best educated opinions available statistics primary sources information nevertheless risk assessment produce information senior executives organization primary risks easy understand risk management decisions prioritized within overall company goals thus several theories attempts quantify risks numerous different risk formulae exist perhaps widely accepted formula risk quantification rate probability occurrence multiplied impact event equals risk magnitudevague
risk optionsedit
risk mitigation measures usually formulated according following major risk options

design business process adequate builtin risk control containment measures start
periodically reassess risks accepted ongoing processes normal feature business operations modify mitigation measures
transfer risks external agency insurance company
avoid risks altogether closing particular highrisk business area

later researchcitation needed shown financial benefits risk management less dependent formula used dependent frequency risk assessment performed
business imperative able present findings risk assessments financial market schedule terms robert courtney 1970 proposed formula presenting risks financial terms courtney formula accepted official risk analysis method governmental agencies formula proposes calculation annualized loss expectancy compares expected loss value security control implementation costs costbenefit analysis
potential risk treatmentsedit
risks identified assessed techniques manage risk fall four major categories10

avoidance eliminate withdraw become involved
reduction optimize mitigate
sharing transfer outsource insure
retention accept budget

ideal risk control strategies possible involve tradeoffs acceptable organization person making risk management decisions another source department defense link defense acquisition university calls categories acat avoid control accept transfer acat acronym reminiscent another acat acquisition category used defense industry procurements risk management figures prominently decision making planning
risk avoidanceedit
includes performing activity could carry risk example would buying property business order take legal liability comes another would flying order take risk airplane hijacked avoidance seem answer risks avoiding risks also means losing potential gain accepting retaining risk allowed entering business avoid risk loss also avoids possibility earning profits increasing risk regulation hospitals avoidance treating higher risk conditions favor patients presenting lower risk11
risk reductionedit
risk reduction optimization involves reducing severity loss likelihood loss occurring example sprinklers designed fire reduce risk loss fire method cause greater loss water damage therefore suitable halon fire suppression systems mitigate risk cost prohibitive strategy
acknowledging risks positive negative optimizing risks means finding balance negative risk benefit operation activity risk reduction effort applied offshore drilling contractor effectively applying health safety environment management organization optimize risk achieve levels residual risk tolerable12
modern software development methodologies reduce risk developing delivering software incrementally early methodologies suffered fact delivered software final phase development problems encountered earlier phases meant costly rework often jeopardized whole project developing iterations software projects limit effort wasted single iteration
outsourcing could example risk reduction outsourcer demonstrate higher capability managing reducing risks13 example company outsource software development manufacturing hard goods customer support needs another company handling business management company concentrate business development without worry much manufacturing process managing development team finding physical location call center
risk sharingedit
briefly defined sharing another party burden loss benefit gain risk measures reduce risk
term risk transfer often used place risk sharing mistaken belief transfer risk third party insurance outsourcing practice insurance company contractor bankrupt court original risk likely still revert first party terminology practitioners scholars alike purchase insurance contract often described transfer risk however technically speaking buyer contract generally retains legal responsibility losses transferred meaning insurance described accurately postevent compensatory mechanism example personal injuries insurance policy transfer risk accident insurance company risk still lies policy holder namely person accident insurance policy simply provides accident event occurs involving policy holder compensation payable policy holder commensurate sufferingdamage
ways managing risk fall multiple categories risk retention pools technically retaining risk group spreading whole group involves transfer among individual members group different traditional insurance premium exchanged members group front instead losses assessed members group
risk retentionedit
involves accepting loss benefit gain risk occurs true selfinsurance falls category risk retention viable strategy small risks cost insuring risk would greater time total losses sustained risks avoided transferred retained default includes risks large catastrophic either cannot insured premiums would infeasible example since property risks insured loss attributed retained insured also amounts potential loss risk amount insured retained risk also acceptable chance large loss small cost insure greater coverage amounts great would hinder goals organization much
risk management planedit
main article risk management plan
select appropriate controls countermeasures measure risk risk mitigation needs approved appropriate level management instance risk concerning image organization management decision behind whereas management would authority decide computer virus risks
risk management plan propose applicable effective security controls managing risks example observed high risk computer viruses could mitigated acquiring implementing antivirus software good risk management plan contain schedule control implementation responsible persons actions
according isoiec 27001 stage immediately completion risk assessment phase consists preparing risk treatment plan document decisions identified risks handled mitigation risks often means selection security controls documented statement applicability identifies particular control objectives controls standard selected
implementationedit
implementation follows planned methods mitigating effect risks purchase insurance policies risks decided transferred insurer avoid risks avoided without sacrificing entitys goals reduce others retain rest
review evaluation planedit
initial risk management plans never perfect practice experience actual loss results necessitate changes plan contribute information allow possible different decisions made dealing risks faced
risk analysis results management plans updated periodically primary reasons

evaluate whether previously selected security controls still applicable effective
evaluate possible risk level changes business environment example information risks good example rapidly changing business environment

limitationsedit
prioritizing risk management processes highly could keep organization ever completing project even getting started especially true work suspended risk management process considered complete
also important keep mind distinction risk uncertainty risk measured impacts probability
risks improperly assessed prioritized time wasted dealing risk losses likely occur spending much time assessing managing unlikely risks divert resources could used profitably unlikely events occur risk unlikely enough occur better simply retain risk deal result loss fact occur qualitative risk assessment subjective lacks consistency primary justification formal risk assessment process legal bureaucratic
areasedit
applied corporate finance risk management technique measuring monitoring controlling financial operational risk firms balance sheet traditional measure value risk also measures like profit risk margin risk basel framework breaks risks market risk price risk credit risk operational risk also specifies methods calculating capital requirements components
information technology risk management includes incident handling action plan dealing intrusions cybertheft denial service fire floods securityrelated events according sans institute14 step process preparation identification containment eradication recovery lessons learned
enterpriseedit
main article enterprise risk management
enterprise risk management risk defined possible event circumstance negative influences enterprise question impact existence resources human capital products services customers enterprise well external impacts society markets environment financial institution enterprise risk management normally thought combination credit risk interest rate risk asset liability management liquidity risk market risk operational risk
general case every probable risk preformulated plan deal possible consequences ensure contingency risk becomes liability
