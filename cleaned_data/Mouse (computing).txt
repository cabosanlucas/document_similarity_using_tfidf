mouse gesturesedit
main article pointing device gesture
users also employ mice gesturally meaning stylized motion mouse cursor called gesture issue command specific action example drawing program moving mouse rapid motion shape might delete shape
gestural interfaces occur rarely plain pointingandclicking people often find difficult require finer motor control user however gestural conventions become widespread including drag drop gesture

user presses mouse button mouse cursor hovers interface object
user moves cursor different location holding button
user releases mouse button

example user might draganddrop picture representing file onto picture trash thus instructing system delete file
standard semantic gestures include

crossingbased goal
drag drop
menu traversal
pointing
rollover mouseover
