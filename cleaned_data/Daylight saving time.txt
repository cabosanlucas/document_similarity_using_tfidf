rationaleedit
industrialized societies generally follow clockbased schedule daily activities change throughout course year time individuals begin work school coordination mass transit example usually remain constant yearround contrast agrarian societys daily routines work personal conduct likely governed length daylight hours89 solar time change seasonally earths axial tilt north south tropics daylight lasts longer summer shorter winter effect becoming greater moves away tropics
synchronously resetting clocks region hour ahead standard time hour fast individuals follow yearround schedule wake hour earlier would otherwise begin complete daily work routines hour earlier available extra hour daylight workday activities1011 however fewer hour daylight start making policy less practical winter1213
times sunrise sunset change roughly equal rates seasons change proponents daylight saving time argue people prefer greater increase daylight hours typical nine five workday1415 supporters also argued decreases energy consumption reducing need lighting heating actual effect overall energy heavily disputed
manipulation time higher latitudes example iceland nunavut alaska little impact daily life length night changes extremely throughout seasons comparison latitudes thus sunrise sunset times significantly phase standard working hours regardless manipulations clock16 also little locations near equator regions small variation daylight course year17 effect also varies according east west location within time zone locations farther east inside time zone benefiting locations farther west time zone18

ancient water clock lets hour lengths vary season


although schedules clock modern sense ancient civilizations adjusted daily schedules flexibly often dividing daylight twelve hours regardless daytime daylight hour longer summer19 example romans kept time water clocks different scales different months year romes latitude third hour sunrise hora tertia started modern standards 0902 solar time lasted minutes winter solstice summer solstice started 0658 lasted minutes20 ancient times equallength civil hours eventually supplanted unequal civil time longer varies season unequal hours still used traditional settings monasteries mount athos21 jewish ceremonies22

changes rules cause problems existing computer installations example 2007 change rules north america required many computer systems upgraded greatest impact email calendar programs upgrades required significant effort corporate information technologists144
applications standardize avoid problems clock shifts time zone differences145 likewise modern operating systems internally handle store times convert local time display146147
however even used internally systems still require external leap second updates time zone information correctly calculate local time needed many systems today base datetime calculations data derived iana time zone database also known zoneinfo
iana time zone databaseedit
iana time zone database maps name named locations historical predicted clock shifts database used many computer software systems including unixlike operating systems java oracle rdbms148 tztab database similar incompatible149 temporal authorities change rules zoneinfo updates installed part ordinary system maintenance unixlike systems environment variable specifies location name tzamericanewyork many systems also systemwide setting applied environment variable setting controlled contents etclocaltime file usually symbolic link hard link zoneinfo files internal time stored timezoneindependent epoch time used potentially many simultaneous users processes independently localize time display
older strippeddown systems support values required posix specify start rule explicitly value example tzest5edtm3200200m11100200 specifies time eastern united states starting 2007 value must changed whenever rules change value applies years mishandling older timestamps150

limitations caused problems example 2005 israel varied year skipped years windows used rules correct 1995 causing problems later years windows microsoft marked israel forcing israeli users shift computer clocks manually twice year 2005 israeli daylight saving established predictable rules using jewish calendar windows zone files could represent rules dates yearindependent partial workarounds mishandled older time stamps included manually switching zone files every year153 microsoft tool switches zones automatically154 2013 israel standardized daylight saving time according gregorian calendar155
microsoft windows keeps system realtime clock local time causes several problems including compatibility multi booting operating systems clock doubleadjusting clock multi booting different windows versions rescue boot disk approach problem even windowsonly systems support peruser timezone settings single systemwide setting 2008 microsoft hinted future versions windows partially support windows registry entry realtimeisuniversal introduced many years earlier windows supported risc machines clocks maintained156 since least fixes related feature published microsoft157158
ntfs file system used recent versions windows stores file time stamp displays corrected local—or seasonal—time however filesystem commonly used removable devices stores local time consequently file copied hard disk onto separate media time current local time time adjustment changed timestamps original file copy different effect observed compressing uncompressing files file archivers ntfs file changes seen time effect kept mind trying determine file duplicate another although methods comparing files equality using checksum algorithm
