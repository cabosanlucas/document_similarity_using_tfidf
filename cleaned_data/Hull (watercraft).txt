hull form lines lengthwise crosssection


hull watertight body ship boat hull superstructure andor deckhouse present line hull meets water surface called waterline
structure hull varies depending vessel type typical modern steel ship structure consists watertight nontight decks major transverse watertight also sometimes nontight longitudinal members called bulkheads intermediate members girders stringers webs minor members called ordinary transverse frames frames longitudinals depending structural arrangement uppermost continuous deck called upper deck weather deck spar deck main deck simply deck particular name given depends context—the type ship boat arrangement even sails hulls decked instance dinghy
typical wooden sailboat hull constructed wooden planking supported transverse frames often referred ribs bulkheads tied together longitudinal stringers ceiling often always centerline longitudinal member called keel fiberglass composite hulls structure resemble wooden steel vessels extent monocoque arrangement many cases composite hulls built sandwiching thin fiberreinforced skins lightweight reasonably rigid core foam balsa wood impregnated paper honeycomb material

displacement

hull supported exclusively predominantly buoyancy vessels type hull travel water limited rate defined waterline length often though always heavier planing types

planing





royal navy world planing speed calm water showing hard chine hull forepart boat water


planing hull form configured develop positive dynamic pressure draft decreases increasing speed dynamic lift reduces wetted surface therefore also drag sometimes flatbottomed sometimes vbottomed rarely roundbilged common form least chine makes efficient planing throw spray planing hulls efficient higher speeds although still require energy achieve speeds effective planing hull must light possible flat surfaces consistent good keeping sail boats plane must also sail efficiently displacement mode light winds

semidisplacement semiplaning

hull form capable developing moderate amount dynamic lift however vessels weight still supported buoyancy

principal hull measurements









hull forms defined follows



block measures define principal dimensions




beam breadth width hull maximum beam waterline
draft vertical distance bottom keel waterline
freeboard depth plus height keel structure minus draft
length waterline length forwardmost point waterline measured profile sternmost point waterline
