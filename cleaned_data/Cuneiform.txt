sumerian inscription monumental archaic style 26th century


cuneiform script developed pictographic protowriting late millennium stemming near eastern token system used accounting mesopotamias protoliterate period spans roughly 35th 32nd centuries first documents unequivocally written sumerian date 31st century jemdet nasr
originally pictographs either drawn clay tablets vertical columns sharpened reed stylus incised stone early style lacked characteristic wedge shape strokes
certain signs indicate names gods countries cities vessels birds trees known determinatives sumerian signs terms question added guide reader proper names continued usually written purely logographic fashion
earliest known sumerian king whose name appears contemporary cuneiform tablets enmebaragesi kish surviving records gradually become less fragmentary complete following reigns presargonic period become standard practice major citystate date documents yearnames commemorating exploits lugal king
2900 many pictographs began lose original function given sign could various meanings depending context sign inventory reduced 1500 signs signs writing became increasingly phonological determinative signs reintroduced avoid ambiguity cuneiform writing proper thus arises primitive system pictographs time early bronze

archaic cuneiform script adopted akkadian empire 23rd century short chronology beginning middle bronze 20th century evolved assyrian cuneiform many modifications sumerian orthography semitic languages employed equivalents many signs distorted abbreviated represent values syllabic nature script refined sumerians intuitive semitic speakers stage former pictograms reduced high level abstraction composed five basic wedge shapes horizontal vertical diagonals winkelhaken impressed vertically stylus signs exemplary basic wedges

mixed method writing continued babylonian assyrian empires although periods purism fashion marked tendency spell words laboriously preference using signs phonetic complement even days babylonian syllabary remained mixture logographic phonemic writing

proper namesedit
early days cuneiform decipherment reading proper names presented greatest difficulties however better understanding principles behind formation pronunciation thousands names found historical records business documents votive inscriptions literary productions legal documents primary challenge posed characteristic sumerian nonphonetic logograms languages different pronunciations symbols exact phonetic reading many names determined parallel passages explanatory lists scholars remained doubt recourse conjectural provisional readings fortunately many cases variant readings name written phonetically whole part instance logographically another
transliterationedit




extract cyrus cylinder lines 15–21 giving genealogy cyrus great account capture babylon


cuneiform specific format transliteration scripts polyvalence transliteration requires certain choices transliterating scholar must decide case sign several possible meanings intended original document example sign dingir hittite text represent either hittite syllable part akkadian phrase representing syllable sumerogram representing original sumerian meaning determinative deity transliteration different rendition glyph chosen depending role present context
therefore text containing dingir succession could construed represent words accusative case ending water divine name water someone transcribing signs would make decision signs read assemble signs godaccusative case transliteration signs however would separate signs dashes dingira still easier read original cuneiform reader able trace sounds back original signs determine correct decision made read transliterated document thus presents reading preferred transliterating scholar well opportunity reconstruct original text
differing conventions transliterating sumerian akkadian babylonian hittite luwian cuneiform texts convention sees wide across different fields acute grave accents abbreviation homophone disambiguation thus equivalent first glyph expressing phonetic acute accent equivalent second grave accent third glyph series sequence numbering conventional essentially arbitrary subject history decipherment sumerian transliteration multiplication sign used indicate typographic ligatures shown signs represented capital letters specific reading selected transliteration represented small letters thus capital letters used indicate socalled diri compound sign sequence combination reading different individual constituent signs example compound igia water reading imhur meaning foam diri compound individual signs separated dots transliteration capital letters also used indicate sumerogram example kùbabbar sumerian silver used intended akkadian reading kaspum silver akkadogram simply sign sequence whose reading editor uncertain naturally real reading clear presented small letters transliteration igia rendered imhur4
since sumerian language widely known studied scholars approximately century changes accepted reading sumerian names occurred time time thus name king read urbau time later read urengur read urnammu urnamma lugalzagesi king uruk scholars continued read ungalzaggisi forth also names older period often uncertainty whether bearers sumerians semites former names could assumed read sumerian semites signs writing names probably read according semitic equivalents though occasionally semites might encountered bearing genuine sumerian names also doubt whether signs composing semites name represented phonetic reading logographic compound thus inscriptions semitic ruler kish whose name written urumuush first deciphered name first taken logographic muush could read founded city sumerian scholars accordingly retranslated back original semitic aluusharshid later recognized sign also read name akkadian king rimush
