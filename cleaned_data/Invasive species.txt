scientists include species ecosystem factors among mechanisms combined establish invasiveness newly introduced species
speciesbased mechanismsedit
species compete survive invasive species appear specific traits specific combinations traits allow outcompete native species cases competition rates growth reproduction cases species interact directly
researchers disagree usefulness traits invasiveness markers study found list invasive noninvasive species invasive species could identified traits alone10 another study found invasive species tended small subset presumed traits many similar traits found noninvasive species requiring explanations101112 common invasive species traits include following

fast growth
rapid reproduction
high dispersal ability
phenotypic plasticity ability alter growth form suit current conditions

prior successful invasions14

typically introduced species must survive population densities becomes invasive location15 population densities difficult introduced species reproduce maintain location species might reach location multiple times becomes established repeated patterns human movement ships sailing ports cars driving highways offer repeated opportunities establishment also known high propagule pressure16
introduced species might become invasive outcompete native species resources nutrients light physical space water food species evolved great competition predation environment host fewer able competitors allowing invader proliferate quickly ecosystems used fullest capacity native species modeled zerosum systems gain invader loss native however unilateral competitive superiority extinction native species increased populations invader rule1718 invasive species often coexist native species extended time gradually superior competitive ability invasive species becomes apparent population grows larger denser adapts location

invasive species might able resources previously unavailable native species deep water sources accessed long taproot ability live previously uninhabited soil types example barbed goatgrass aegilops triuncialis introduced california serpentine soils waterretention nutrient levels high magnesiumcalcium ratio possible heavy metal toxicity plant populations soils tend show density goatgrass form dense stands soils crowd native species adapted poorly serpentine soils19
invasive species might alter environment releasing chemical compounds modifying abiotic factors affecting behaviour herbivores creating positive negative impact species species like kalanchoe daigremontana produce allelopathic compounds might inhibitory effect competing species species like stapelia gigantea facilitates recruitment seedlings species arid environments providing appropriate microclimatic conditions preventing herbivory early stages development20
examples centaurea solstitialis yellow starthistle centaurea diffusa diffuse knapweed eastern european noxious weeds spread western west coast states experiments show 8hydroxyquinoline chemical produced root diffusa negative effect plants coevolved coevolved native plants also evolved defenses diffusa solstitialis appear native habitats overwhelmingly successful competitors success lack success habitat necessarily imply success others conversely examining habitats species less successful reveal novel weapons defeat invasiveness2122
changes fire regimens another form facilitation bromus tectorum originally eurasia highly fireadapted spreads rapidly burning also increases frequency intensity heat fires providing large amounts detritus fire season western north america areas widespread altered local fire regimen much native plants cannot survive frequent fires allowing tectorum extend maintain dominance introduced range23
facilitation also occurs species physically modifies habitat ways advantageous species example zebra mussels increase habitat complexity lake floors providing crevices invertebrates live increase complexity together nutrition provided waste products mussel filterfeeding increases density diversity benthic invertebrate communities24
ecosystembased mechanismsedit
ecosystems amount available resources extent resources used organisms determines effects additional species ecosystem stable ecosystems equilibrium exists available resources mechanisms describe situation ecosystem suffered disturbance changes fundamental nature ecosystem25
changes forest fire occur normal succession favors native grasses forbs introduced species spread faster natives resources would available native species squeezing nitrogen phosphorus often limiting factors situations26
every species occupies niche native ecosystem species fill large varied roles others highly specialized invading species fill niches used native species also create niches27 example type found within lampropholis delicata species skink
ecosystem changes alter species distributions example edge effects describe happens part ecosystem disturbed land cleared agriculture boundary remaining undisturbed habitat newly cleared land forms distinct habitat creating winners losers possibly hosting species would thrive outside boundary habitat28
interesting finding studies invasive species shown introduced populations great potential rapid adaptation used explain many introduced species able establish become invasive environments bottlenecks founder effects cause great decrease population size constrict genetic variation29 individuals begin show additive variance opposed epistatic variance conversion actually lead increased variance founding populations allows rapid adaptive evolution30 following invasion events selection initially capacity disperse well physiological tolerance stressors environment adaptation proceeds respond selective pressures environment responses would likely temperature climate change presence native species whether predator prey31 adaptations include changes morphology physiology phenology plasticity
rapid adaptive evolution species leads offspring higher fitness better suited environment intraspecific phenotypic plasticity preadaptation postintroduction evolution major factors adaptive evolution32 plasticity populations allows room changes better suit individual environment adaptive evolution main goal best suited ecosystem species introduced ability accomplish quickly possible lead population high fitness preadaptations evolution initial introduction also play role success introduced species species adapted similar ecosystem contains traits happen well suited area introduced likely fare better environment addition evolution takes place introduction determine species able become established ecosystem reproduce thrive
