social psychologists studied attitude formation structure attitudes attitude change function attitudes relationship attitudes behavior people influenced situation general attitudes always good predictors specific behavior example variety reasons person value environment recycle particular
recent times research attitudes examined distinction traditional selfreported attitude measures implicit unconscious attitudes example experimentscitation needed using implicit association test found people often demonstrate implicit bias races even explicit responses reveal equal mindedness study found explicit attitudes correlate verbal behavior interracial interactions whereas implicit attitudes correlate nonverbal behavior12
hypothesis attitudes formed first advanced abraham tesser 1983 strong likes dislikes rooted genetic makeup tesser speculates individuals disposed hold certain strong attitudes result inborn physical sensory cognitive skills temperament personality traits whatever disposition nature elects give treasured attitudes often formed result exposure attitude objects history rewards punishments attitude parents friends enemies express social cultural context live types experiences obviously attitudes formed basic process learning numerous studies shown people form strong positive negative attitudes toward neutral objects linked emotionally charged stimuli13185–186
attitudes also involved several areas discipline conformity interpersonal attraction social perception prejudice
persuasionedit
main article persuasion

channel medium including printed word radio television internet facetoface interactions
context including environment group dynamics preamble messageclarification needed

dualprocess theories persuasion elaboration likelihood model maintain persuasive process mediated separate routes central peripheral central route persuasion factbased results longer lasting change requires motivation process peripheral route superficial results shorter lasting change require much motivation process example peripheral route persuasion might politician using flag lapel smiling wearing crisp clean shirt notice require motivation persuasive last long persuasion based central route politician outline exactly believed previous voting record would using central route would result longer lasting change would require good deal motivation process
social cognitionedit
main article social cognition
social cognition growing area social psychology studies people perceive think remember information otherscitation needed much research rests assertion people think people differently nonsocial targets15 assertion supported social cognitive deficits exhibited people williams syndrome autism16 person perception study people form impressions others study people form beliefs interacting known interpersonal perception
major research topic social cognition attribution17 attributions explanations make peoples behavior either behavior behavior others ascribe locus behavior either internal external factors internal dispositional attribution assigns behavior causes related inner traits personality disposition character ability external situational attribution involves situational elements weather18111 second element attribution ascribes cause behavior either stable unstable factors whether behavior repeated changed similar circumstances finally also attribute causes behavior either controllable uncontrollable factors much control situation hand
numerous biases attribution process discovered instance fundamental attribution error tendency make dispositional attributions behavior overestimating influence personality underestimating influence situations19724 actorobserver difference refinement bias tendency make dispositional attributions peoples behavior situational attributions own18107 selfserving bias tendency attribute dispositional causes successes situational causes failure particularly selfesteem threatened leads assuming ones successes innate traits ones failures situations including people18109 ways people protect selfesteem believing world blaming victims suffering making defensive attributions explain behavior ways defend feelings vulnerability mortality18111 researchers found mildly depressed individuals often lack bias actually realistic perceptions reality measured opinions others20
heuristics cognitive short cuts instead weighing evidence making decision people rely heuristics save time energy availability heuristic occurs people estimate probability outcome based easy outcome imagine vivid highly memorable possibilities perceived likely harder picture difficult understand resulting corresponding cognitive biascontradictory representativeness heuristic shortcut people categorize something based similar prototype know of1863 numerous biases found social cognition researchers hindsight bias false memory predicted events exaggeration actual predictions becoming aware outcome confirmation bias type bias leading tendency search interpret information confirms ones preconceptionscitation needed
another concept social cognition assumption reality complex easily discern result tend world according simplified schemas images reality schemas generalized mental representations organize knowledge guide information processing schemas often operate automatically unintentionally lead biases perception memory expectations schemas lead something experiment found people likely misperceive weapon hands black white man21 type schema actually stereotype generalized beliefs particular group people incorrect ultimate attribution error stereotypes often related negative preferential attitudes prejudice behavior discrimination schemas behaviors going restaurant laundry known scriptscitation needed
selfconceptedit
main article selfconcept
selfconcept term referring whole beliefs people however specifically selfconcept consist according hazel markus 1977 selfconcept made cognitive molecules called selfschemas beliefs people guide processing selfreliant information example athlete university would multiple selves would process different information pertinent self student would self would process information pertinent student taking notes class completing homework assignment athlete would self processes information things related athlete recognizing incoming pass aiming shot selves part ones identity selfreliant information information relies proper self process react self part ones identity much difficult react example civilian know handle hostile threat trained marine would marine contains self would enable himher process information hostile threat react accordingly whereas civilian contain self disabling properly processing information hostile threat furthermore debilitating acting accordingly selfschemas individual’s total self–concept hypothesis theory book library good example body weight selfschema people regard underweight body image significant selfconcept aspect considered schematics respect weight people range otherwise mundane events grocery shopping clothes eating going beach trigger thoughts self contrast people regard weight important part lives aschematic attribute22
rather clear self special object attention whether mentally focused memory conversation foul smell song stuck ones head sentence consciousness like spotlight spotlight shine object time switch rapidly object another process information awarenessclarification needed spotlight self front center things relating self spotlight oftencitation needed
selfs abcs affect behavior cognition affective emotional question people evaluate enhance selfimage maintain secure sense identity behavioral question people regulate actions present others according interpersonal demands cognitive question individuals become build selfconcept uphold stable sense identity1353
affective forecasting process predicting would feel response future emotional events studies done timothy wilson daniel gilbert 2003 shown people overestimate strength reaction anticipated positive negative life events actually feel event occur23
many theories perception behavior daryl bems 1972 selfperception theory claims internal cues difficult interpret people gain selfinsight observing behavior24 leon festingers 1954 social comparison theory people evaluate abilities opinions comparing others uncertain ability opinions25 also facial feedback hypothesis changes facial expression lead corresponding changes emotion1356
fields social psychology personality merged years social psychologists developed interest selfrelated phenomena contrast traditional personality theory however social psychologists place greater emphasis cognitions traits much research focuses selfconcept persons understanding self selfconcept often divided cognitive component known selfschema evaluative component selfesteem need maintain healthy selfesteem recognized central human motivation field social psychologycitation needed
selfefficacy beliefs associated selfschema expectations performance task effective successful social psychologists also study selfrelated processes selfcontrol selfpresentationcitation needed
people develop selfconcepts varied means including introspection feedback others selfperception social comparison comparison relevant others people gain information make inferences relevant selfesteem social comparisons either upward downward comparisons people either higher status ability lower status ability downward comparisons often made order elevate selfesteemcitation needed
selfperception specialized form attribution involves making inferences oneself observing ones behavior psychologists found many extrinsic rewards money tend reduce intrinsic motivation selfperception process phenomenon known overjustification peoples attention directed reward lose interest task reward longer offered26 important exception reinforcement theory
interpersonal phenomenaedit
social influenceedit
main article social influence
social influence overarching term given describe persuasive effects people seen fundamental value social psychology overlaps considerably research attitudes persuasion three main areas social influence include conformity compliance obedience social influence also closely related study group dynamics principles influence strongest take place social groups
first major area social influence conformity conformity defined tendency think like members group identity members within group status similarity expertise well cohesion prior commitment accountability group help determine level conformity individual individual variation among group members plays role dynamic willing people conform2727 conformity usually viewed negative tendency american culture certain amount conformity adaptive situations nonconformity situations2715




line matches first line asch conformity experiments people frequently followed majority judgment even majority objectively wrong


second major area social influence research compliance compliance refers change behavior request suggestion another person footinthedoor technique compliance method persuader requests small favor follows requesting larger favor asking time asking dollars related trick bait switch28
third major form social influence obedience change behavior result direct order command another person obedience form compliance dramatically highlighted milgram study wherein people ready administer shocks person distress researchers command2741
unusual kind social influence selffulfilling prophecy prediction made actually causes become true example stock market widely believed crash imminent investors lose confidence sell stock thus actually cause crash similarly people expect hostility others actually induce hostility behavior1818
group dynamicsedit
main article group dynamics
group defined individuals connected another social relationships29 groups tend interact influence share common identity number emergent qualities distinguish aggregates

norms implicit rules expectations group members follow saying thank shaking hands
roles implicit rules expectations specific members within group oldest sibling additional responsibilities family
relations patterns liking within group also differences prestige status leaders popular people

temporary groups aggregates share none features qualify true social groups people waiting line example constitute groupcitation needed
groups important offer social support resources feeling belonging supplement individuals selfconcept large extent humans define group memberships form social identity shared social identity individuals within group influences intergroup behavior groups behave towards perceive perceptions behaviors turn define social identity individuals within interacting groups tendency define oneself membership group lead intergroup discrimination involves favorable perceptions behaviors directed towards ingroup negative perceptions behaviors directed towards outgroup30 hand discrimination segregation sometimes exist partly facilitate diversity strengthens society31 intergroup discrimination leads prejudice stereotyping processes social facilitation group polarization encourage extreme behaviors towards outgroup
groups often moderate improve decision makingcitation needed frequently relied upon benefits committees juries number group biases however interfere effective decision making example group polarization formerly known risky shift occurs people polarize views extreme direction group discussion problematic phenomenon groupthink collective thinking defect characterized premature consensus incorrect assumption consensus caused members group failing promote views consistent views members groupthink occurs variety situations including isolation group presence highly directive leader janis offered 1961 pigs invasion historical case groupthink32
groups also affect performance productivity social facilitation example tendency work harder faster presence others social facilitation increases dominant responses likelihood tends improve performance simple tasks reduce complex taskscitation needed contrast social loafing tendency individuals slack working group social loafing common task considered unimportant individual contributions easy see33unreliable source
social psychologists study grouprelated collective phenomena behavior crowds important concept area deindividuation reduced state selfawareness caused feelings anonymity deindividuation associated uninhibited sometimes dangerous behavior common crowds mobs also caused disguise uniform alcohol dark environments online anonymitycitation needed34




social psychologists study interactions within groups groups individuals


interpersonal attractionedit
main article interpersonal attraction
major area study peoples relations interpersonal attraction refers forces lead people like establish relationships cases fall love several general principles attraction discovered social psychologists many still continue experiment research find important factors interpersonal attraction similar particular people similar people general attitudes backgrounds environments worldviews traits probable attraction possible35full citation needed
physical attractiveness important element romantic relationships particularly early stages characterized high levels passion later similarity compatibility factors become important type love people experience shifts passionate companionate robert sternberg suggested actually three components love intimacy passion commitment36 people experience three said state consummate love
according social exchange theory relationships based rational choice costbenefit analysis partners costs begin outweigh benefits person leave relationship especially good alternatives available theory similar minimax principle proposed mathematicians economists despite fact human relationships zerosum games time long term relationships tend become communal rather simply based exchangecitation needed

methodsedit
social psychology empirical science attempts answer questions human behavior testing hypotheses laboratory field careful attention sampling research design statistical analysis important results published peer reviewed journals journal experimental social psychology personality social psychology bulletin journal personality social psychology social psychology studies also appear general science journals psychological science science
experimental methods involve researcher altering variable environment measuring effect another variable example would allowing groups children play violent nonviolent videogames observing subsequent level aggression freeplay period valid experiment controlled uses random assignment
correlational methods examine statistical association naturally occurring variables example could correlate amount violent television children watch home number violent incidents children participate school note study would prove violent causes aggression children quite possible aggressive children choose watch violent
observational methods purely descriptive include naturalistic observation contrived observation participant observation archival analysis less common social psychology sometimes used first investigating phenomenon example would unobtrusively observe children playground videocamera perhaps record number types aggressive actions displayed
whenever possible social psychologists rely controlled experimentation controlled experiments require manipulation independent variables order examine effect dependent variable experiments useful social psychology high internal validity meaning free influence confounding extraneous variables likely accurately indicate causal relationship however small samples used controlled experiments typically external validity degree results generalized larger population usually tradeoff experimental control internal validity able generalize population external validity
usually impossible test everyone research tends conducted sample persons wider population social psychologists frequently survey research interested results high external validity surveys various forms random sampling obtain sample respondents representative population type research usually descriptive correlational experimental control variables however statistical methods like structural equation modeling used test potential causal relationships type datacitation needed psychologists including david sears criticized social psychological research relying heavily studies conducted university undergraduates academic settings experiments sears study used north american undergraduates subjects subset population representative population whole37
regardless method chosen used results high importance results need used evaluate hypothesis research done results either confirm reject original hypothesis predictedthere different types testing social psychologists order test results statistics probability testing define significant finding less likely chance replications important ensure result valid chance feature particular sample false positive conclusions often resulting pressure publish authors confirmation bias hazard field39
ethicsedit
goal social psychology understand cognition behavior naturally occur social context observing people influence alter behavior reason many social psychology experiments utilize deception conceal distort certain aspects study deception include false cover stories false participants known confederates stooges false feedback given participants onclarification needed
practice deception challenged psychologists maintain deception circumstances unethical research strategies roleplaying used instead unfortunately research shown roleplaying studies produce results deception studies cast doubt validitycitation needed addition deception experimenters times people potentially uncomfortable embarrassing situations milgram experiment stanford prison experiment also criticized ethical reasons
protect rights wellbeing research participants time discover meaningful results insights human behavior virtually social psychology research must pass ethical review process colleges universities conducted ethics committee institutional review board group examines proposed research make sure harm likely done participants studys benefits outweigh possible risks discomforts people taking part study
furthermore process informed consent often used make sure volunteers know happen experimentclarification needed understand allowed quit experiment time debriefing typically done experiments conclusion order reveal deceptions used generally make sure participants unharmed proceduresclarification needed today research social psychology involves risk harm expected routine psychological testing normal daily activitiescitation needed
replication crisisedit
main article replication crisis
social psychology recently found center replication crisis research findings proving difficult replicate replication failures unique social psychology found fields science however several factors combined social psychology center current controversy
firstly questionable research practices identified common field practices necessarily intentionally fraudulent involve converting undesired statistical outcomes desired outcomes manipulation statistical analyses sample size data management typically convert nonsignificant findings significant ones39 studies suggested least mild versions highly prevalent40 critics daryl feeling future controversy suggested evidence precognition study could least part attributed
secondly social psychology found center several recent scandals involving outright fraudulent research notably admitted data fabrication diederik stapel41 well allegations others however scholars acknowledge fraud perhaps lesser contribution replication crisescitation needed
third several effects social psychology found difficult replicate even current replication crisis example scientific journal judgment decision making published several studies years fail provide support unconscious thought theory replications appear particularly difficult research trials preregistered conducted research groups highly invested theory questioning
three elements together resulted renewed attention replication supported daniel kahneman scrutiny many effects shown several core beliefs hard replicate recent special edition journal social psychology focused replication studies number previously held beliefs found difficult replicate42 2012 special edition journal perspectives psychological science also focused issues ranging publication bias nullaversion contribute replication crises psychology43
important note replication crisis mean social psychology unscientificcitation needed rather process healthy sometimes acrimonious part scientific process ideas cannot withstand careful scrutiny pruned44 consequence areas social psychology considered solid social priming come increased scrutiny failed replications45
famous experimentsedit




milgram experiment experimenter persuades participant give participant believes painful electric shocks another participant actually actor many participants continued give shocks despite pleas mercy actor


asch conformity experiments demonstrated power conformity small groups line estimation task designed extremely easy46 third trials participants conformed majority even though majority judgment clearly wrong seventyfive percent participants conformed least experiment
muzafer sherifs robbers cave experiment divided boys competing groups explore much hostility aggression would emerge sherifs explanation results became known realistic group conflict theory intergroup conflict induced competition resources47 inducing cooperation superordinate goals later reversed effect
leon festingers cognitive dissonance experiment participants asked perform boring task divided groups given different scales studys participants paid enjoyed task another group participants paid first group later reported liking task better second group festingers explanation people first group paid sufficient incentive lying paid experienced dissonance could overcome dissonance justifying lies changing previously unfavorable attitudes task paid provides reason boring task therefore dissonance4849
notable experiments social psychology milgram experiment studied people would obey authority figure following events holocaust world experiment showed normal american citizens capable following orders authority even believed causing innocent person suffer50
albert banduras bobo doll experiment demonstrated aggression learned imitation51 studies fueled debates regarding media violence continue waged among scholars
stanford prison study philip zimbardo simulated exercise student prisoners guards showed people would follow adopted role days guards became brutal cruel prisoners became miserable compliant initially argued important demonstration power immediate social situation capacity overwhelm normal personality traits52 however remains matter contention conclusions drawn study example pointed participant selfselection affected participants behaviour53 participants personality influenced reactions variety ways including long chose remain studycitation needed concerted empirical revisitations themes raised zimbardo came 2002 prison study54
