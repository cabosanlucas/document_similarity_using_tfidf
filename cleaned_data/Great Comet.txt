great comet 1680 rotterdam painted lieve verschuier


vast majority comets never bright enough seen naked generally pass inner solar system unseen anyone except astronomers however occasionally comet brighten naked visibility even rarely become bright brighter brightest stars requirements occur large active nucleus close approach close approach earth comet fulfilling three criteria certainly spectacular sometimes comet failing criterion still extremely impressive example comet hale–bopp exceptionally large active nucleus approach closely still became extremely famous well observed comet equally comet hyakutake rather small comet appeared bright passed extremely close earth
size activity nucleusedit
cometary nuclei vary size hundreds metres across less many kilometres across approach large amounts dust ejected cometary nuclei solar heating crucial factor bright comet becomes large active nucleus many returns inner solar system cometary nuclei become depleted volatile materials thus much less bright comets making first passage solar system
sudden brightening comet 17pholmes 2007 showed importance activity nucleus comets brightness october 23–24 2007 comet suffered sudden outburst caused brighten factor half million unexpectedly brightened apparent magnitude period hours making visible naked temporarily made comet largest radius object solar system although nucleus estimated diameter
close perihelion approachedit
brightness simple reflective body varies inverse square distance objects distance halved brightness quadrupled however comets behave differently ejection large amounts volatile also reflect sunlight also fluoresce brightness varies roughly inverse cube distance meaning comets distance halved become eight times bright
means peak brightness comet depends significantly distance comets perihelion orbit lies outside earths orbit comet approaching within less chance becoming great comet
close approach earthedit




halleys comets 1986 apparition unusually modest brightness


comet become spectacular also needs pass close earth halleys comet example usually bright passes inner solar system every seventysix years 1986 apparition closest approach earth almost distant possible comet became visible naked unspectacular hand intrinsically small faint comet hyakutake c1996 appeared bright spectacular close approach earth nearest march 1996 passage near earth closest cometary approaches record
