concepts representational theory mindedit
within framework representational theory mind structural position concepts understood follows concepts serve building blocks called mental representations colloquially understood ideas mind mental representations turn building blocks called propositional attitudes colloquially understood stances perspectives take towards ideas believing doubting wondering accepting propositional attitudes turn building blocks understanding thoughts populate everyday life well folk psychology analysis ties common everyday understanding thoughts scientific philosophical understanding concepts6

simplest terms concept name label regards treats abstraction concrete material existence person place thing represent natural object exists real world like tree animal stone also name artificial manmade object like chair computer house abstract ideas knowledge domains freedom equality science happiness also symbolized concepts important realize concept merely symbol representation abstraction word mistaken thing example word moon concept large bright shapechanging object represents celestial object concepts created named describe explain capture reality known understood
priori conceptsedit
main articles priori posteriori category kant
kant declared human minds possess pure priori concepts instead abstracted individual perceptions like empirical concepts originate mind called concepts categories sense word means predicate attribute characteristic quality pure categories predicates things general particular thing according kant categories constitute understanding phenomenal objects category predicate common multiple empirical concepts order explain priori concept relate individual phenomena manner analogous posteriori concept kant employed technical concept schema held account concept abstraction experience partly correct called concepts result abstraction posteriori concepts meaning concepts arise experience empirical posteriori concept general representation vorstellung nonspecific thought common several specific perceived objects logic note
concept common feature characteristic kant investigated empirical posteriori concepts created

logical acts understanding concepts generated form

comparison likening mental images another relation unity consciousness
reflection going back different mental images comprehended consciousness finally
abstraction segregation everything else mental images differ

order make mental images concepts must thus able compare reflect abstract three logical operations understanding essential general conditions generating concept whatever example willow linden firstly comparing objects notice different another respect trunk branches leaves like however reflect common trunk branches leaves abstract size shape forth thus gain concept tree

classical theoryedit
main article definitionism
classical theory concepts also referred empiricist theory concepts9 oldest theory structure concepts traced back aristotle10 prominently held 1970s10 classical theory concepts says concepts definitional structure4 adequate definitions kind required theory usually take form list features features must important qualities provide comprehensive definition10 features entailed definition concept must necessary sufficient membership class things covered particular concept10 feature considered necessary every member denoted class feature feature considered sufficient something parts required definition10 example classic example bachelor said defined unmarried man4 entity bachelor definition unmarried check whether something member class compare qualities features definition9 another part theory obeys excluded middle means partial members class either out10
classical theory persisted long unquestioned seemed intuitively correct great explanatory power explain concepts would acquired categorize structure concept determine referent class4 fact many years major activities philosophy concept analysis4 concept analysis trying articulate necessary sufficient conditions membership referent class conceptcitation needed example shoemakers classic time without change explored whether concept flow time include flows changes take place though change usually taken definition time
arguments classical theoryedit
given later theories concepts born rejection classical theory8 seems appropriate give account might wrong theory 20th century philosophers wittgenstein rosch argued classical theory primary arguments8 summarized follows

seems simply definitions especially based sensory primitive concepts8
seems though cases ignorance error class means either dont know definition concept incorrect notions definition particular concept might entail8
quines argument analyticity dogmas empiricism also holds argument definitions8
concepts fuzzy membership items vague whether fall particular referent class possible classical theory everything equal full membership8
rosch found typicality effects cannot explained classical theory concepts sparked prototype theory8
psychological experiments show evidence using concepts strict definitions8

prototype theoryedit
main article prototype theory
prototype theory came problems classical view conceptual structure4 prototype theory says concepts specify properties members class tend possess rather must possess8 wittgenstein rosch mervis berlin anglin posner proponents creators theory813 wittgenstein describes relationship members class family resemblances necessarily necessary conditions membership still three legs10 view particularly supported psychological experimental evidence prototypicality effects10 participants willingly consistently rate objects categories like vegetable furniture less typical class1013 seems categories fuzzy psychologically structure explanatory power10 judge items membership referent class concept comparing typical member central member concept similar enough relevant ways cognitively admitted member relevant class entities10 rosch suggests every category represented central exemplar embodies maximum possible number features given category10 according lech gunturkun suchan explain categorization involves many areas brain visual association areas prefrontal cortex basal ganglia temporal lobe
