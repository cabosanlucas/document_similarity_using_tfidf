chemical substance well defined material definite chemical composition introductory general chemistry textbook4 according definition chemical substance either pure chemical element pure chemical compound exceptions definition pure substance also defined form matter definite composition distinct properties5 chemical substance index published also includes several alloys uncertain composition6 nonstoichiometric compounds special case inorganic chemistry violates constant composition sometimes difficult draw line mixture compound case palladium hydride broader definitions chemicals chemical substances found example term chemical substance means organic inorganic substance particular molecular identity including combination substances occurring whole part result chemical reaction occurring nature7
geology substances uniform composition called minerals physical mixtures aggregates several minerals different substances defined rocks many minerals however mutually dissolve solid solutions single rock uniform substance despite mixture stoichiometric terms feldspars common example anorthoclase alkali aluminum silicate alkali metal interchangeably either sodium potassium
chemical substances include pure substances mixtures defined composition manufacturing process example regulation reach defines monoconstituent substances multiconstituent substances substances unknown variable composition latter consist multiple chemical substances however identity established either direct chemical analysis reference single manufacturing process example charcoal extremely complex partially polymeric mixture defined manufacturing process therefore although exact chemical identity unknown identification made sufficient accuracy index also includes mixtures
polymers almost always appear mixtures molecules multiple molar masses could considered separate chemical substance however polymer defined known precursor reactions molar mass distribution example polyethylene mixture long chains repeating units generally sold several molar mass distributions ldpe mdpe hdpe uhmwpe
historyedit
concept chemical substance became firmly established late eighteenth century work chemist joseph proust composition pure chemical compounds basic copper carbonate8 deduced samples compound composition samples proportions mass elements present compound known constant composition9 later advancement methods chemical synthesis particularly realm organic chemistry discovery many chemical elements techniques realm analytical chemistry used isolation purification elements compounds chemicals establishment modern chemistry concept defined found chemistry textbooks however controversies regarding definition mainly large number chemical substances reported chemistry literature need indexed
isomerism caused much consternation early researchers since isomers exactly composition differ configuration arrangement atoms example much speculation chemical identity benzene correct structure described friedrich august kekulé likewise idea stereoisomerism atoms rigid threedimensional structure thus form isomers differ threedimensional arrangement another crucial step understanding concept distinct chemical substances example tartaric acid three distinct isomers pair diastereomers diastereomer forming enantiomers

pure chemical compound chemical substance composed particular molecules ions elements combined substance chemical reaction form chemical compound compounds substances substances compounds
chemical compound either atoms bonded together molecules crystals atoms molecules ions form crystalline lattice compounds based primarily carbon hydrogen atoms called organic compounds others called inorganic compounds compounds containing bonds carbon metal called organometallic compounds
compounds components share electrons known covalent compounds compounds consisting oppositely charged ions known ionic compounds salts
organic chemistry chemical compound composition molecular weight generally called isomers isomers usually substantially different chemical properties isolated spontaneously convert common example glucose fructose former aldehyde latter ketone interconversion requires either enzymatic acidbase catalysis however also tautomers isomerization occurs spontaneously pure substance cannot isolated tautomers common example glucose openchain ring forms cannot manufacture pure openchain glucose glucose spontaneously cyclizes hemiacetal form materials also comprise entities polymers inorganic organic sometimes combination inorganic organic
substances versus mixturesedit




cranberry glass looks homogeneous mixture consisting glass gold colloidal particles diameter give color


main article mixture
matter consists various elements chemical compounds often intimately mixed together mixtures contain chemical substance fixed composition principle separated component substances purely mechanical processes butter soil wood common examples mixtures
grey iron metal yellow sulfur chemical elements mixed together ratio form yellowgrey mixture chemical process occurs material identified mixture fact sulfur iron separated mechanical process using magnet attract iron away sulfur
contrast iron sulfur heated together certain ratio atom iron atom sulfur weight grams iron grams sulfur chemical reaction takes place substance formed compound ironii sulfide chemical formula resulting compound properties chemical substance mixture ironii sulfide distinct properties melting point solubility elements cannot separated using normal mechanical processes magnet unable recover iron since metallic iron present compound
chemicals versus chemical substancesedit
term chemical substance precise technical term synonymous chemical chemists word chemical used general usage english speaking world refer pure chemical substances mixtures often called compounds12 especially produced purified laboratory industrial process131415 words chemical substances fruits vegetables example naturally composed even growing wild called chemicals general usage countries require list ingredients products chemicals listed industrially produced chemical substances word chemical also often used refer addictive narcotic mindaltering drugs1314
within chemical industry manufactured chemicals chemical substances classified production volume bulk chemicals fine chemicals chemicals found research

bulk chemicals produced large quantities usually highly optimized continuous processes relatively price
fine chemicals produced high cost small quantities special lowvolume applications biocides pharmaceuticals speciality chemicals technical applications
research chemicals produced individually research searching synthetic routes screening substances pharmaceutical activity effect price gram high although sold

cause difference production volume complexity molecular structure chemical bulk chemicals usually much less complex fine chemicals complex many simple enough sold building blocks synthesis complex molecules targeted single named production chemical includes synthesis also purification eliminate byproducts impurities involved synthesis last step production analysis batch lots chemicals order identify quantify percentages impurities buyer chemicals required purity analysis depends application higher tolerance impurities usually expected production bulk chemicals thus user chemical might choose bulk technical grade higher amounts impurities much purer pharmaceutical grade labeled united states pharmacopeia chemicals commercial legal sense also include mixtures highly variable composition products made technical specification instead particular chemical substances example gasoline single chemical compound even particular mixture different gasolines different chemical compositionsl gasoline primarily defined source properties octane rating
naming indexingedit
every chemical substance systematic names usually named according iupac rules naming alternative system used chemical abstracts service
many compounds also known common simpler names many predate systematic name example longknown sugar glucose systematically named 6hydroxymethyloxane2345tetrol natural products pharmaceuticals also given simpler names example mild painkiller naproxen common name chemical compound s6methoxyαmethyl2naphthaleneacetic acid
chemists frequently refer chemical compounds using chemical formulae molecular structure compound phenomenal growth number chemical compounds synthesized isolated reported scientific literature professional chemists around world16 enormous number chemical compounds possible chemical combination known chemical elements 2011 sixty million chemical compounds known17 names many compounds often nontrivial hence easy remember cite accurately also difficult keep track literature several international organizations like iupac initiated steps make tasks easier provides abstracting services chemical literature provides numerical identifier known registry number chemical substance reported chemical literature chemistry journals patents information compiled database popularly known chemical substances index computerfriendly systems developed substance information smiles international chemical identifier inchi
