programming language notation writing programs specifications computation algorithm3 authors restrict term programming language languages express possible algorithms34 traits often considered important constitutes programming language include

function target
computer programming language language used write computer programs involves computer performing kind computation5 algorithm possibly control external devices printers disk drives robots6 example postscript programs frequently created another program control computer printer display generally programming language describe computation possibly abstract machine generally accepted complete specification programming language includes description possibly idealized machine processor language7 practical contexts programming language involves computer consequently programming languages usually defined studied way8 programming languages differ natural languages natural languages used interaction people programming languages also allow humans communicate instructions machines
abstractions
programming languages usually contain abstractions defining manipulating data structures controlling flow execution practical necessity programming language support adequate abstractions expressed abstraction principle9 principle sometimes formulated recommendation programmer make proper abstractions10
expressive power
theory computation classifies languages computations capable expressing turing complete languages implement algorithms ansiiso sql92 charity examples languages turing complete often called programming languages1112

markup languages like html troff define structured data usually considered programming languages131415 programming languages however share syntax markup languages computational semantics defined xslt example turing complete dialect161718 moreover latex mostly used structuring documents also contains turing complete subset1920
term computer language sometimes used interchangeably programming language21 however usage terms varies among authors including exact scope usage describes programming languages subset computer languages22 vein languages used computing different goal expressing computer programs generically designated computer languages instance markup languages sometimes referred computer languages emphasize meant used programming23
another usage regards programming languages theoretical constructs programming abstract machines computer languages subset thereof runs physical computers finite hardware resources24 john reynolds emphasizes formal specification languages much programming languages languages intended execution also argues textual even graphical input formats affect behavior computer programming languages despite fact commonly turingcomplete remarks ignorance programming language concepts reason many flaws input formats25

early developmentsedit
earliest computers often programmed without help programming language writing programs absolute machine language programs decimal binary form read punched cards magnetic tape toggled switches front panel computer absolute machine languages later termed firstgeneration programming languages
next step development socalled secondgeneration programming languages assembly languages still closely tied instruction architecture specific computer served make program much humanreadable relieved programmer tedious errorprone address calculations
first highlevel programming languages thirdgeneration programming languages written 1950s early highlevel programming language designed computer plankalkül developed german konrad zuse 1943 1945 however implemented 1998 200026
john mauchlys short code proposed 1949 first highlevel languages ever developed electronic computer27 unlike machine code short code statements represented mathematical expressions understandable form however program translated machine code every time making process much slower running equivalent machine code
university manchester alick glennie developed autocode early 1950s programming language used compiler automatically convert language machine code first code compiler developed 1952 mark computer university manchester considered first compiled highlevel programming language2829
second autocode developed mark brooker 1954 called mark autocode brooker also developed autocode ferranti mercury 1950s conjunction university manchester version edsac devised hartley university cambridge mathematical laboratory 1961 known edsac autocode straight development mercury autocode adapted local circumstances noted object code optimisation sourcelanguage diagnostics advanced time contemporary separate thread development atlas autocode developed university manchester atlas machine
1954 fortran invented john backus first widely used highlevel general purpose programming language functional implementation opposed design paper3031 still popular language highperformance computing32 used programs benchmark rank worlds fastest supercomputers33
another early programming language devised grace hopper called flowmatic developed univac remington rand period 1955 1959 hopper found business data processing customers uncomfortable mathematical notation early 1955 team wrote specification english programming language implemented prototype34 flowmatic compiler became publicly available early 1958 substantially complete 195935 flowmatic major influence design cobol since direct descendant aimaco actual time36
refinementedit
increased highlevel languages introduced requirement lowlevel programming languages system programming languages languages varying degrees provide facilities assembly languages highlevel languages used perform tasks require direct access hardware facilities still provide higherlevel control structures errorchecking
period 1960s late 1970s brought development major language paradigms

introduced array programming influenced functional programming37
algol refined structured procedural programming discipline language specification revised report algorithmic language algol became model later language specifications written
lisp implemented 1958 first dynamically typed functional programming language
1960s simula first language designed support objectoriented programming mid1970s smalltalk followed first purely objectoriented language
developed 1969 1973 system programming language unix operating system remains popular38
prolog designed 1972 first logic programming language
1978 built polymorphic type system lisp pioneering statically typed functional programming languages

languages spawned descendants modern programming languages count least ancestry
1960s 1970s also considerable debate merits structured programming whether programming languages designed support it39 edsger dijkstra famous 1968 letter published communications argued goto statements eliminated higher level programming languages40

selection textbooks teach programming languages popular obscure thousands programming languages dialects designed history


1980s years relative consolidation combined objectoriented systems programming united states government standardized systems programming language derived pascal intended defense contractors japan elsewhere vast sums spent investigating socalled fifth generation languages incorporated logic programming constructs41 functional languages community moved standardize lisp rather inventing paradigms movements elaborated upon ideas invented previous decades
important trend language design programming largescale systems 1980s increased focus modules largescale organizational units code modula2 developed notable module systems 1980s often wedded generic programming constructs42
rapid growth internet mid1990s created opportunities languages perl originally unix scripting tool first released 1987 became common dynamic websites java came used serverside programming bytecode virtual machines became popular commercial settings promise write anywhere ucsd pascal popular time early 1980s developments fundamentally novel rather refinements many existing languages paradigms although syntax often based family programming languages
programming language evolution continues industry research current directions include security reliability verification kinds modularity mixins delegates aspects database integration microsofts linq

main article syntax programming languages




parse tree python code inset tokenization






syntax highlighting often used programmers recognizing elements source code language python


programming languages surface form known syntax programming languages purely textual sequences text including words numbers punctuation much like written natural languages hand programming languages graphical nature using visual relationships symbols specify program
syntax language describes possible combinations symbols form syntactically correct program meaning given combination symbols handled semantics either formal hardcoded reference implementation since languages textual article discusses textual syntax
programming language syntax usually defined using combination regular expressions lexical structure backus–naur form grammatical structure simple grammar based lisp


expression atom list
atom number symbol
number
symbol azaz
list expression

grammar specifies following

expression either atom list
atom either number symbol
number unbroken sequence decimal digits optionally preceded plus minus sign
symbol letter followed zero characters excluding whitespace
list matched pair parentheses zero expressions inside

following examples wellformed token sequences grammar 12345 c232
syntactically correct programs semantically correct many syntactically correct programs nonetheless illformed languages rules depending language specification soundness implementation result error translation execution cases programs exhibit undefined behavior even program welldefined within language still meaning intended person wrote
using natural language example possible assign meaning grammatically correct sentence sentence false

colorless green ideas sleep furiously grammatically wellformed generally accepted meaning
john married bachelor grammatically wellformed expresses meaning cannot true

following language fragment syntactically correct performs operations semantically defined operation meaning value complex type defined value null pointer


complex null
complex absp sqrtp

type declaration first line omitted program would trigger error compilation variable would defined program would still syntactically correct since type declarations provide semantic information
grammar needed specify programming language classified position chomsky hierarchy syntax programming languages specified using type2 grammar contextfree grammars43 languages including perl lisp contain constructs allow execution parsing phase languages constructs allow programmer alter behavior parser make syntax analysis undecidable problem generally blur distinction parsing execution44 contrast lisps macro system perls begin blocks contain general computations macros merely string replacements require code execution45
semanticsedit
term semantics refers meaning languages opposed form syntax
static semanticsedit
static semantics defines restrictions structure valid texts hard impossible express standard syntactic formalisms3 compiled languages static semantics essentially include semantic rules checked compile time examples include checking every identifier declared used languages require declarations labels arms case statement distinct46 many important restrictions type like checking identifiers used appropriate context adding integer function name subroutine calls appropriate number type arguments enforced defining rules logic called type system forms static analyses like data flow analysis also part static semantics newer programming languages like java definite assignment analysis form data flow analysis part static semantics
dynamic semanticsedit
main article semantics programming languages
data specified machine must instructed perform operations data example semantics define strategy expressions evaluated values manner control structures conditionally execute statements dynamic semantics also known execution semantics language defines various constructs language produce program behavior many ways defining execution semantics natural language often used specify execution semantics languages commonly used practice significant amount academic research went formal semantics programming languages allow execution semantics specified formal manner results field research seen limited application programming language design implementation outside academia
type systemedit
main articles data type type system type safety
type system defines programming language classifies values expressions types manipulate types interact goal type system verify usually enforce certain level correctness programs written language detecting certain incorrect operations decidable type system involves tradeoff rejects many incorrect programs also prohibit correct albeit unusual programs order bypass downside number languages type loopholes usually unchecked casts used programmer explicitly allow normally disallowed operation different types typed languages type system used type check programs number languages usually functional ones infer types relieving programmer need write type annotations formal design study type systems known type theory
typed versus untyped languagesedit
language typed specification every operation defines types data operation applicable implication applicable types47 example data represented text quotes string many programming languages dividing number string meaning rejected compilers invalid operation detected program compiled static type checking rejected compiler compilation error message detected program dynamic type checking resulting runtime exception many languages allow function called exception handler written handle exception example always return result
special case typed languages singletype languages often scripting markup languages rexx sgml data type—most commonly character strings used symbolic numeric data
contrast untyped language assembly languages allows operation performed data generally considered sequences bits various lengths47 highlevel languages untyped include bcpl varieties forth
practice languages considered typed point view type theory verifying rejecting operations modern languages offer degree typing47 many production languages provide means bypass subvert type system trading typesafety finer control programs execution casting
static versus dynamic typingedit
static typing expressions types determined prior program executed typically compiletime example integer expressions cannot passed function expects string stored variable defined hold dates47
statically typed languages either manifestly typed typeinferred first case programmer must explicitly write types certain textual positions example variable declarations second case compiler infers types expressions declarations based context mainstream statically typed languages java manifestly typed complete type inference traditionally associated less mainstream languages haskell however many manifestly typed languages support partial type inference example java infer types certain limited cases48 additionally programming languages allow types automatically converted types example used program expects float
dynamic typing also called latent typing determines typesafety operations time words types associated runtime values rather textual expressions47 typeinferred languages dynamically typed languages require programmer write explicit type annotations expressions among things permit single variable refer values different types different points program execution however type errors cannot automatically detected piece code actually executed potentially making debugging difficult lisp smalltalk perl python javascript ruby examples dynamically typed languages
weak strong typingedit
weak typing allows value type treated another example treating string number47 occasionally useful also allow kinds program faults undetected compile time even time
strong typing prevents attempt perform operation wrong type value raises error47 strongly typed languages often termed typesafe safe
alternative definition weakly typed refers languages perl javascript permit large number implicit type conversions javascript example expression implicitly converts number conversion succeeds even null undefined array string letters implicit conversions often useful mask programming errors strong static generally considered orthogonal concepts usage literature differs term strongly typed mean strongly statically typed even confusingly mean simply statically typed thus called strongly typed weakly statically typed4950
seem professional programmers could weakly statically typed however notice generic pointer void pointer allow casting pointers pointers without needing explicit cast extremely similar somehow casting array bytes kind datatype without using explicit cast char
standard library runtime systemedit
main article standard library
programming languages associated core library sometimes known standard library especially included part published language standard conventionally made available implementations language core libraries typically include definitions commonly used algorithms data structures mechanisms input output
line language core library differs language language cases language designers treat library separate entity language however languages core library often treated part language users language specifications even require library made available implementations indeed languages designed meanings certain syntactic constructs cannot even described without referring core library example java string literal defined instance javalangstring class similarly smalltalk anonymous function expression block constructs instance librarys blockcontext class conversely scheme contains multiple coherent subsets suffice construct rest language library macros language designers even bother portions language must implemented language constructs must implemented parts library
design implementationedit
programming languages share properties natural languages related purpose vehicles communication syntactic form separate semantics showing language families related languages branching another5152 artificial constructs also differ fundamental ways languages evolved usage significant difference programming language fully described studied entirety since precise finite definition53 contrast natural languages changing meanings given users different communities constructed languages also artificial languages designed ground specific purpose lack precise complete semantic definition programming language
many programming languages designed scratch altered meet needs combined languages many eventually fallen disuse although attempts design universal programming language serves purposes failed generally accepted filling role54 need diverse programming languages arises diversity contexts languages used

programs range tiny scripts written individual hobbyists huge systems written hundreds programmers
programmers range expertise novices need simplicity else experts comfortable considerable complexity
programs must balance speed size simplicity systems ranging microcontrollers supercomputers
programs written change generations undergo continual modification
programmers simply differ tastes accustomed discussing problems expressing particular language

common trend development programming languages ability solve problems using higher level abstraction earliest programming languages tied closely underlying hardware computer programming languages developed features added programmers express ideas remote simple translation underlying hardware instructions programmers less tied complexity computer programs computing less effort programmer lets write functionality time unit55
natural language programming proposed eliminate need specialized language programming however goal remains distant benefits open debate edsger dijkstra took position formal language essential prevent introduction meaningless constructs dismissed natural language programming foolish56 alan perlis similarly dismissive idea57 hybrid approaches taken structured english
languages designers users must construct number artifacts govern enable practice programming important artifacts language specification implementation
specificationedit
main article programming language specification
specification programming language artifact language users implementors agree upon whether piece source code valid program language behavior shall
programming language specification take several forms including following

explicit definition syntax static semantics execution semantics language syntax commonly specified using formal grammar semantic definitions written natural language language formal semantics standard ml58 scheme59 specifications
description behavior translator language fortran specifications syntax semantics language inferred description written natural formal language
reference model implementation sometimes written language specified prolog ansi rexx60 syntax semantics language explicit behavior reference implementation
