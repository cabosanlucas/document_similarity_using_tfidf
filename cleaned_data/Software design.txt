overviewedit
software design process implementing software solutions sets problems main components software design software requirements analysis part software development process lists specifications used software engineering software semiautomated user centered software design involve user experience design yielding storyboard help determine specifications software completely automated meaning user user interface software design simple flow chart text describing planned sequence events also semistandard methods like unified modeling language fundamental modeling concepts either case documentation plan usually product design furthermore software design platformindependent platformspecific depending upon availability technology used design
main difference software analysis design output software analysis consists smaller problems solve additionally analysis designed differently across different team members groups contrast design focuses capabilities thus multiple designs problem exist depending environment design often varies whether created reliable frameworks implemented suitable design patterns design examples include operation systems webpages mobile devices even cloud computing paradigm
software design process model design process sequence steps enables designer describe aspects software building creative skill past experience sense makes good software overall commitment quality examples critical success factors competent design important note however design process always straightforward procedure design model compared architect’s plans house begins representing totality thing built threedimensional rendering house slowly thing refined provide guidance constructing detail plumbing similarly design model created software provides variety different views computer software basic design principles enable software engineer navigate design process davis dav95full citation needed suggests principles software design adapted extended following list

design process suffer tunnel vision good designer consider alternative approaches judging based requirements problem resources available
design traceable analysis model single element design model often traced back multiple requirements necessary means tracking requirements satisfied design model
design reinvent wheel systems constructed using design patterns many likely encountered patterns always chosen alternative reinvention time short resources limited design time invested representing truly ideas integrating patterns already exist applicable
design minimize intellectual distance software problem exists real world structure software design whenever possible mimic structure problem domain
design exhibit uniformity integration design uniform appears fully coherent order achieve outcome rules style format defined design team design work begins design integrated care taken defining interfaces design components
design structured accommodate change design concepts discussed next section enable design achieve principle
design structured degrade gently even aberrant data events operating conditions encountered well designed software never bomb designed accommodate unusual circumstances must terminate processing graceful manner
design coding coding design even detailed procedural designs created program components level abstraction design model higher source code design decisions made coding level address small implementation details enable procedural design coded
design assessed quality created fact variety design concepts design measures available assist designer assessing quality throughout development process
design reviewed minimize conceptual semantic errors sometimes tendency focus minutiae design reviewed missing forest trees design team ensure major conceptual elements design omissions ambiguity inconsistency addressed worrying syntax design model

design conceptsedit
design concepts provide software designer foundation sophisticated methods applied fundamental design concepts evolved follows

abstraction abstraction process result generalization reducing information content concept observable phenomenon typically order retain information relevant particular purposeit representing essential features without including background details explanations
refinement process elaboration hierarchy developed decomposing macroscopic statement function stepwise fashion programming language statements reached step several instructions given program decomposed detailed instructions abstraction refinement complementary concepts
modularity software architecture divided components called modules
software architecture refers overall structure software ways structure provides conceptual integrity system good software architecture yield good return investment respect desired outcome project terms performance quality schedule cost
control hierarchy program structure represents organization program component implies hierarchy control
structural partitioning program structure divided horizontally vertically horizontal partitions define separate branches modular hierarchy major program function vertical partitioning suggests control work distributed program structure
data structure representation logical relationship among individual elements data
software procedure focuses processing module individually
information hiding modules specified designed information contained within module inaccessible modules need information

object model grady booch mentions abstraction encapsulation modularisation hierarchy fundamental software design principles3 acronym phame principles hierarchy abstraction modularisation encapsulation sometimes used refer four fundamental principles4
design considerationsedit
many aspects consider design piece software importance consideration reflect goals expectations software created meet aspects

compatibility software able operate products designed interoperability another product example piece software backwardcompatible older version
extensibility capabilities added software without major changes underlying architecture
modularity resulting software comprises well defined independent components leads better maintainability components could implemented tested isolation integrated form desired software system allows division work software development project
faulttolerance software resistant able recover component failure
maintainability measure easily fixes functional modifications accomplished high maintainability product modularity extensibility
reliability software durability software able perform required function stated conditions specified period time
reusability ability aspects preexisting software projects little modification
robustness software able operate stress tolerate unpredictable invalid input example designed resilience memory conditions
security software able withstand resist hostile acts influences
usability software user interface must usable target useraudience default values parameters must chosen good choice majority users5
performance software performs tasks within timeframe acceptable user require much memory
portability software usable across number different conditions environments
scalability software adapts well increasing data number users satisfaction
