purpose
domain names serve identify internet resources computers networks services textbased label easier memorize numerical addresses used internet protocols domain name represent entire collections resources individual instances individual internet host computers domain names host identifiers also called host names term host name also used leaf labels domain name system usually without subordinate domain name space host names appear component uniform resource locators urls internet resources sites enwikipediaorg
domain names also used simple identification labels indicate ownership control resource examples realm identifiers used session initiation protocol domain keys used verify domains email systems many uniform resource identifiers uris
important function domain names provide easily recognizable memorizable names numerically addressed internet resources abstraction allows resource moved different physical location address topology network globally locally intranet move usually requires changing address resource corresponding translation address domain name
domain names used establish unique identity organizations choose domain name corresponds name helping internet users reach easily
generic domain name defines general category rather specific personal instance example name industry rather company name examples generic names bookscom musiccom travelinfo companies created brands based generic names generic domain names valuablecitation needed

hierarchical domain name system organized zones served domain name servers


domain name space consists tree domain names node tree holds information associated domain name tree subdivides zones beginning root zone
domain name syntax
domain name consists parts technically called labels conventionally concatenated delimited dots examplecom

rightmost label conveys toplevel domain example domain name wwwexamplecom belongs toplevel domain
hierarchy domains descends right left label name label left specifies subdivision subdomain domain right example label example specifies node examplecom subdomain domain label create wwwexamplecom subdomain examplecom label contain octets empty label reserved root node fully qualified expressed empty label terminated full domain name exceed total length ascii characters textual representation5 thus using single character label limit levels characters plus dots total length practice domain registries shorter limits
hostname domain name least associated address example domain names wwwexamplecom examplecom also hostnames whereas domain however toplevel domains particularly country code toplevel domains indeed address also hostnames
hostnames impose restrictions characters allowed corresponding domain name valid hostname also valid domain name valid domain name necessarily valid hostname

toplevel domains
toplevel domains tlds highest level domain names internet toplevel domains form root zone hierarchical domain name system every domain name ends toplevel domain label
domain name system devised 1980s domain name space divided main groups domains6 country code toplevel domains cctld primarily based twocharacter territory codes iso3166 country abbreviations addition group seven generic toplevel domains gtld implemented represented categories names multiorganizations7 domains

internationalized domain names
main article internationalized domain name
character allowed domain name system based ascii allow representation names words many languages native scripts alphabets icann approved internationalized domain name idna system maps unicode strings used application user interfaces valid character encoding called punycode example københavneu mapped xnkbenhavn54aeu many registries adopted idna

icann publishes complete list registries domain name registrars registrant information associated domain names maintained online database accessible whois protocol country code toplevel domains cctlds domain registries maintain whois registrant name servers expiration dates information
domain name registries often called network information centers also function registrars endusers major generic toplevel domain registries info domains others registryregistrar model consisting hundreds domain name registrars lists icann20 verisign21 method management registry manages domain name database relationship registrars registrants users domain name customers registrar cases additional layers resellers
technical requirements process
process registering domain name maintaining authority name space created registrars several pieces information connected domain

administrative contact registrant usually designates administrative contact manage domain name administrative contact usually highest level control domain management functions delegated administrative contacts include management business information name record postal address contact information official registrant domain obligation conform requirements domain registry order retain right domain name furthermore administrative contact installs additional contact information technical billing functions
technical contact technical contact manages name servers domain name functions technical contact include assuring conformance configurations domain name requirements domain registry maintaining domain zone records providing continuous functionality name servers leads accessibility domain name
billing contact party responsible receiving billing invoices domain name registrar paying applicable fees
name servers registrars provide name servers part registration service however registrant specify authoritative name servers host domains resource records registrars policies govern number servers type server information required providers require hostname corresponding address hostname must resolvable either domain exist elsewhere based traditional requirements 1034 typically minimum servers required

domain names formed alphanumeric ascii characters characters caseinsensitive addition hyphen u002d permitted surrounded characters digits hyphens although start label labels always separated full stop period character textual name representation
business models
domain names often seen analogy real estate domain names foundations website built highest quality domain names like soughtafter real estate tend carry significant value usually online brandbuilding potential advertising search engine optimization many criteria
companies offered lowcost belowcost even free domain registration variety models adopted recoup costs provider usually require domains hosted website within framework portal includes advertising wrapped around domain holders content revenue allows provider recoup costs domain registrations free charge domain holder provide infinite number subdomains domain example owner exampleorg could provide subdomains fooexampleorg foobarexampleorg interested parties
