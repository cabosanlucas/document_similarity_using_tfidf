History[edit]
Main article: History of Emory University




Glenn Memorial United Methodist Church, Emory University






Asa Griggs Candler, founder of The Coca-Cola Company, provided a land grant for Emory College to relocate to metropolitan Atlanta and be rechartered as Emory University.[52] Based on large donations from the Candler, Woodruff, Goizueta, and Rollins families, Emory University is colloquially referred to as "Coca-Cola University."[53]


Nineteenth century[edit]
Emory College was founded in 1836 in Oxford, Georgia by the Methodist Episcopal Church.[54] The college was named in honor of the departed Methodist bishop John Emory.[54] Ignatius Alphonso Few was the college's first president. In 1854, the Atlanta Medical College, a forerunner of Emory University School of Medicine, was founded. On April 12, 1861, the American Civil War began. Emory College was closed in November 1861 and all of its students enlisted on the Confederate side.[54] In late 1863 the war came to Georgia and the college was used as hospital and later a headquarters for the Union Army. The university produced many officers who served in the war, including General George Thomas Anderson (1846C) who fought in nearly every major battle in the eastern theater.[55] Thirty five Emory students lost their lives and much of the campus was destroyed during the war.[56]
Emory College, as with the entire Southeastern United States, struggled to overcome financial devastation during the Reconstruction Era. In 1880, Atticus Greene Haygood, Emory College President, delivered a speech expressing gratitude for the end of slavery in the United States, which captured the attention of George I. Seney, a New York banker. Seney gave Emory College $5,000 to repay its debts, $50,000 for construction, and $75,000 to establish a new endowment. In the 1880s, the technology department was launched by Isaac Stiles Hopkins, a polymath professor at Emory College. Hopkins became the first president of the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1888. Emory University's first international student, Yun Chi-ho, graduated in 1893.[57] Yun became an important political activist in Korea and is the author of "Aegukga", the national anthem of the Republic of Korea.[58][59]
Twentieth century[edit]
On August 16, 1906, the Wesley Memorial Hospital and Training School for Nurses, later renamed the Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing, was established. In 1914, the Candler School of Theology was established. In 1915, Emory College relocated to Druid Hills and was rechartered as Emory University after accepting a land grant from Asa Griggs Candler, founder of The Coca-Cola Company. The Emory University School of Law was established in 1916. From the 1920s through the 1970s, Emory University established its reputation as a regional institution that offered a solid education in medicine, law, theology, business, and the liberal arts.
First and Second World Wars[edit]
On April 6, 1917, the United States entered the First World War. Emory University organized a medical unit, composed of medical school faculty and medical alumni, that would be known as Emory Unit, Base Hospital 43. The unit served in Loir-et-Cher, France from July 1918 to January 1919. The Emory Unit, Base Hospital 43 was remobilized during the Second World War and served in the North African Campaign and Europe. To recognize Emory’s participation in the war effort, a ship was christened M.S. Emory Victory and served through World War II and in the Korean War.
In the 1940s, Emory University students, alumni, and faculty served in the Asia-Pacific War and European theater of World War II. Lieutenant Commander James L. Starnes, a graduate of Emory Law, was the navigator of the battleship USS Missouri and served as officer of the deck during the signing of the Japanese Instrument of Surrender.[60] Bobby Jones (golfer), served during the Battle of Normandy.[61] Dr. Alfred A. Weinstein, a professor of surgery at Emory University School of Medicine, was a prisoner of war of the Empire of Japan between 1942 and 1945. His memoir "Barbed Wire Surgeon" is considered one of the finest accounts concerning allied prisoners under Japanese captivity and highlights the abuses of the war criminal Mutsuhiro Watanabe.[62] Kiyoshi Tanimoto, who graduated from the Candler School of Theology in 1940 and is portrayed in John Hersey's Hiroshima (book), was able to organize the Hiroshima Maidens reconstructive surgery program based on the associations he made while studying in the United States.[63] Tatsumasa Shirakawa, a Japanese student at the Candler School of Theology, was placed under arrest temporarily until Dean Henry Burton Trimble negotiated his release. Emory helped the nation prepare for war by participating in the V-12 Navy College Training Program and Army Specialized Training Program, programs designed to supplement the force of commissioned officers in the United States Navy and United States Army. The Candler School of Theology trained men for military chaplaincy. During the war, university enrollment boasted two military students for every one civilian. Emory University alumni would go on to serve in the Korean War, Second Indochina War (Vietnam War), Persian Gulf War, Yugoslav Wars, and the Global War on Terrorism.
Women's and Civil Rights Movement[edit]
The Women's Movement and Civil Rights Movement during the 1950s and 1960s in the United States profoundly shaped the future of Emory University. Formerly an all-male school, Emory officially became a coeducational institution in 1953. Although it had previously admitted women under limited circumstances, the university had never before had a policy through which they could enroll in large numbers and as resident students. In 1959, sororities first appeared on campus. In 1962, in the midst of the Civil Rights Movement, Emory embraced the initiative to end racial restrictions when it asked the courts to declare portions of the Georgia statutes unconstitutional. Previously, Georgia law denied tax-exempt status to private universities with racially integrated student bodies. The Supreme Court of Georgia ruled in Emory's favor and Emory officially became racially integrated. Marvin S. Arrington, Sr. was Emory University's first, full-time African American student and graduated from Emory University School of Law in 1967.[64]




On March 30, 1983, Kim Dae-jung, while in political exile in the US, gave a speech on human rights and democracy at Emory University and accepted an honorary Doctor of Laws degree by the institution. Kim would go on to serve as the 8th President of South Korea.[65][66]


Emory's diversity and academic reputation flourished under the leadership of the university's fifth president, James T. Laney. In addition to leading universities in the Southeastern United States in the promotion of racial equality, Laney and many of the school's faculty and administrators were outspoken advocates of global human rights and thus were openly opposed to the military dictatorship in South Korea (1961-1987). On March 30, 1983, Laney's friend Kim Dae-jung, while in political exile in the United States, presented a speech on human rights and democracy at Emory University and accepted an honorary Doctor of Laws degree.[65] Kim would go on to play a major role in ending authoritarianism in South Korea, served as the 8th President of South Korea from 1998 to 2003, and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2000 for his successful implementation of the Sunshine Policy. Laney would later serve as United States Ambassador to South Korea and the Emory graduate school, founded in 1919, was named in his honor in 2009.[64]
In 2005, the university presented the President Medal, an rare award conferred only on individuals whose impact on the world has enhanced the dominion of peace or has enlarged the range of cultural achievement, to Civil Rights Movement activist Rosa Parks. The award is one of the highest honors presented by Emory.[67]
In 2014, at Emory’s 169th Commencement, John Lewis, the only living "Big Six" leader of the Civil Rights Movement, delivered the keynote address and received an honorary doctor of laws degree. In 2015, Emory University School of Law received a $1.5 million donation to help establish a John Lewis Chair in Civil Rights and Social Justice. The gift, given anonymously, funds a professorship which will enable Emory Law to conduct a national search for a scholar with an established academic profile of distinction and a demonstrated desire to promote the rule of law through the study of civil rights. The law school has committed to raise an additional $500,000 to fund the chair fully.[68]
Expansion and modernization[edit]
The course of Emory's history changed dramatically in November 1979 when Robert Winship Woodruff and George Waldo Woodruff presented the institution with a gift of $105 million in Coca-Cola stock. At the time this was the largest single gift to any institution of higher education in American history, and it made a profound impact on Emory's direction in the next two decades, boosting the university to the top ranks of American research universities.[54]
Twenty-first century[edit]
As one of the fastest-growing research universities in the United States in the 21st century, Emory University has established a national reputation on the strength of the scholarly achievements of its faculty and students, its highly ranked professional schools, a long-term commitment to the arts and sciences, and the presence of more than seventy cutting-edge research centers that are addressing major social problems.[64] Emory has extended its ties to the community, creating close links with Atlanta's neighborhoods, clinics, hospitals, nonprofit organizations, and boardrooms. To accommodate its growth, Emory has undergone a physical transformation that has increased classroom and research space. The latest additions to the campus include buildings for cancer research, biomedical research, scientific computation, mathematics and science, vaccine research, and the performing arts.[64]

The Emory University Center for AIDS Research (CFAR) and the Emory Vaccine Center are world leaders in AIDS Vaccine Development and HIV Pathogenesis studies are funded by nine different institutes of the National Institutes of Health and by the Georgia Research Alliance.[37] The centers include one of the largest groups of academic vaccine scientists in the world and are currently attempting to develop an effective HIV vaccine.[132] Emory University Researchers Dr. Dennis C. Liotta, Dr. Raymond F. Schinazi and Dr. Woo-Baeg Choi discovered Emtricitabine, a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) used in the treatment of HIV. The drug was named as one of the world's most important antiviral drugs by the World Health Organization and is included in their Model List of Essential Medicines.[133]
Emory University is a global leader in Ebola research and treatment. The university was one of three institutions that successfully treated medical evacuees during the 2014 Ebola Outbreak. In 2015, the United States Department of Health and Human Services named Emory University the lead coordinating center for the National Ebola Training and Education Center (NETEC).[41] The university will collaborate with the University of Nebraska Medical Center, the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response on the program, which will receive $12 million in funding over the next five years.The program will support training of health care providers and facilities to manage Ebola and other emerging infectious diseases. Its objectives are to develop metrics to measure facility and health care worker readiness to care for Ebola patients, conduct assessments of state and regional Ebola Treatment Centers, create education materials related to care of patients with possible Ebola and other special pathogens and offer technical and training assistance to public health departments and health facilities.[41] The university also received a $10.8 million grant over three years from the U.S. Department of Defense's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to lead a 10-institution national team developing improved therapeutics and vaccines for multiple strains of Ebola virus.[116] In 2015, Emory received a three-year, $2.2 million grant from the CDC to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, including Ebola, in health-care facilities.[128]
Emory and the Georgia Institute of Technology have a strong research partnership. In 2015, Emory and Georgia Tech were awarded an $8.3 million grant by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to establish a National Exposure Assessment Laboratory.[134] The Laboratory will research the impact of environmental chemicals on children's health.[134] In 2015, the two universities received a five-year, $2.9 million grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to create new bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral degree programs and concentrations in healthcare robotics, which will be the first program of its kind in the Southeastern United States.[135] In 2015, Emory University, Georgia Tech, and Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta were awarded a four-year, $1.8 million grant by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation in order to expand the Atlanta Cystic Fibrosis Research and Development Program. As of 2015, Emory jointly manages the second largest cystic fibrosis population in the United States.[39] In 2015, Emory and Georgia Tech received a $1.6 million grant from the Coulter Translational Research Partnership Program to accelerate nine promising technologies developed in research laboratories with commercialization potential.[116]
In 2015, Emory University received a $15 million grant from the Wounded Warrior Project in order to establish the "Warrior Care Network" and develop innovative approaches to treat veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI).[136]
In 2015, Emory University and the University of South Florida received a $2.5 million grant over five years from the John E. Fogarty International Center (FIC) to study links between infectious disease transmission and agricultural practices.[116]
Campus[edit]

Emory University's original campus was established in Oxford, Georgia in 1836. The 56-acre campus, located 38 miles east of Emory's main Atlanta campus, is home to Oxford College of Emory University and was the site of military headquarters and infirmaries during the American Civil War.[56] Many of the buildings were designed with Neoclassical architecture and Gothic Revival architecture. In 1975, the United States National Register of Historic Places designated the campus as part of the Oxford Historic District.[137]
Emory's main Atlanta campus, established in the early twentieth century on a Beaux-Arts master plan by Pittsburgh architect Henry Hornbostel,[138] covers more than 600 acres in Atlanta's historic suburb of Druid Hills.[139] The university campus is heavily forested with pine, maples, oak, and magnolias, and Peavine Creek, a branch of the Peachtree Creek, runs through the campus. The Arbor Day Foundation named Emory a Tree Campus USA school in 2015.[140] Many of the university's buildings are designed with multi-hued granite and Spanish Saltillo tile. The university has one of the largest inventories by square footage of Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design-certified building space among campuses in the United States.[141] In 2015, The Best Colleges, a Seattle-based educational ranking service, named Emory one of the top ten "Most Amazing College Campuses."[139]
The campus is home to the Emory University Hospital, Michael C. Carlos Museum, which has the largest collection of ancient artifacts in the Southeastern United States, the Winship Cancer Institute, Georgia’s first and only cancer center designated by the National Cancer Institute,[142] the Yerkes National Primate Research Center, one of eight National Institutes of Health–funded national primate research centers, and a number of other academic, art, medical, and student facilitates. Undergraduate dormitories include the Undergraduate Residential Center, Clairmont Residential Center, Tower Apartments, Alabama Hall, Complex, Dobbs Hall, Holmes Hall, Longstreet-Means Hall, Raoul Hall and Turman Hall. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American Cancer Society, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta Egleston hospital, and Emory Point are located adjacent to the campus.
In 2015, a $52 million expansion and renovation project of the Sanford S. Atwood Chemistry Center was completed. The new, 270,000 square-foot complex features state of the art laboratories, interactive teaching and study spaces, and a chemistry library.[143] The completion of the complex was accompanied by a $1.2 million grant from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute to advance and modernize the university's chemistry curriculum.[143]
In the Candler Library Annex of Robert W. Woodruff Library, there is a 1920s Pietro Caproni reproduction of Bertel Thorvaldsen's "The Triumph of Alexander" frieze. The frieze depicts Alexander the Great and his army entering Babylon following their victory over the Achaemenid Empire in the Battle of Gaugamela.[144]
During the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia, the university hosted the United States Olympic women's gymnastics team on its main campus.[145] The team, known as the Magnificent Seven, won the first ever gold medal for the United States in the women's team all-around competition. The university housed international officials and journalists and served as a training facility for Olympians. The Cox Hall Ballroom was transformed into a news center for the Olympic foreign press.[145]
In February 2017, Emory announced that its R. Howard Dobbs University Center, built in 1986 from a neofuturistic postmodernist design by local architect John C. Portman, Jr., to house the university's main student/faculty center and dining hall (Coca-Cola Commons), would be demolished and replaced with a new $98 million Campus Life Center, designed by Durham, North Carolina–based Duda Paine Architects. Reasons given for the replacement included inconvenience of food delivery to the dining hall, undersized kitchen facilities, and inadequate fenestration in the Commons.[138]

Student body[edit]
Emory University's total enrollment for the 2016-2017 academic year is 15,252 students, with 7,916 undergraduates and 7,336 graduate and professional students. Students come from all 50 states and more than 65 countries.[148] The student to faculty ratio is 7:1, with an average class size of 25 students.[149] Of the 1,389 students in the Class of 2018, 46% are Caucasian, 31% are Asian, 10% are Black/African American, 9% are Latino/Hispanic, and 3% did not identity; 56% are female and 44% are male.[150] Emory University has awarded 4,568 degrees during the 2014-2015 year. Of those awards 2,366 were undergraduate and 2,202 were graduate.[151] Emory University's average GPA for incoming freshman is a 3.70-3.97.[152]
Arts[edit]
Students may engage in the performing and fine arts as an area of academic study or as extracurricular activities. Undergraduates may pursue a major in the performing arts (dance, theater, or music) or in film studies, art history, visual arts, or creative writing.[153] Graduate programs in art history, film studies, and music are offered.[154] There are more than 50 student organizations dedicated to the arts. Students can explore artistic interests as diverse as architecture, breakdancing, poetry, and improvisational comedy.[155] Emory routinely hosts arts events in the Schwartz Center for Performing Arts that are open to the Emory and Atlanta communities. Recent performances include Bang on a Can All-Stars (a side project of drummer Glenn Kotche from the rock band Wilco), jazz performer Esperanza Spalding, and New York’s Cedar Lake Dance Company. A program called Creativity Conversations brings artistic minds to campus to discuss art and the creative process. Guests have included Philip Glass, Jimmy Carter, Salman Rushdie, Seamus Heaney and Rita Dove.[156][157][158] Rita Dove also gave the keynote address at Emory's 2013 Commencement.[159]
Athletics[edit]
Emory ranks among top schools in both the U.S. News & World Report’s rankings of the best national universities and the Directors Cup of the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics for best all-around athletics program.[160] Emory's 18 varsity sports teams, known as the Eagles, are members of the NCAA’s Division III University Athletic Association (UAA). However, Emory does not have an intercollegiate football team.[161]

Barkley Forum[edit]
The Barkley Forum Center for Debate Education is an intercollegiate debate organization at Emory University.[162] The center is named in honor of Emory alumnus, Alben Barkley, 35th Vice President of the United States, and is directed by James Herndon. Melissa Maxcy Wade was the previous director until 2015. Debating was established at the university in 1837 and the intercollegiate debate team was formed by Nolan A. Goodyear in 1914. Emory's Barkley Forum debate team has won 3 National Debate Tournaments and over 25 individual champion speaker awards.[163]
Community service[edit]
The university received the 2008 Presidential Award for General Community Service, which is the highest federal recognition given to higher education institutions for their commitment to community service, service-learning and civic engagement.[164] About 25% of Emory students participate in Volunteer Emory, Emory's umbrella community service group. As one of the most popular groups on campus, Volunteer Emory offers dozens of ways to serve the community, working with varied organizations including the Atlanta Community Food Bank, Trees Atlanta, PAWS Atlanta, and Jones Boys and Girls Club.[165] Emory Cares International Service Day brings together students, alumni and other community members to volunteer at a number of projects organized by Emory and its many partners around the city of Atlanta and in cities worldwide.[166]
Newspaper[edit]
The Emory Wheel is the student-run newspaper of Emory University. The Wheel is published twice a week, on Tuesday and Friday, during the regular school year, and is updated regularly at its website. Serving the Emory community since 1919, the Wheel is editorially and financially independent from the University. The staff is composed entirely of students, with the exception of the general manager, who oversees advertising and whose salary is paid by the newspaper. [167][168]
Programs abroad[edit]
Through the Centers of International Programs Abroad, Emory University students can study in over 40 countries at the top academic institutions in the world including the National University of Singapore, Kyoto Consortium for Japanese Studies, Nanjing University, Oxford University, Imperial College London, the School of Oriental and African Studies, Yonsei University, Trinity College Dublin, University of St. Andrews, University of Melbourne, University of Amsterdam, University of Cape Town, and Tel Aviv University.[169]
Residential life[edit]
Fraternities have existed on Emory's campus as early as 1840. One early chronicler makes the case that Emory's "temple" of the Mystic Seven may have been the first chapter of a national fraternity established anywhere in the South. Today, the Greek-letter sororities and fraternities play an important part in leavening Emory's campus life. For undergraduates, Greek life comprises approximately 30% of the Emory student population. The Office of Greek Life recognizes and regulates on-campus chapters of fraternities and sororities.[170] Fraternities have on-campus housing located on Eagle Row, and Sorority Village, a series of townhouses, faces the fraternity houses.[171] Greek Life is an important social engagement for students, but it is not totally exclusive—students from different sororities and fraternities regularly socialize, and the college's emphasis on on-campus housing helps students make friends inside and outside the Greek system.The intramural sports program provides an athletic outlet for the entire Emory community. Emory has numerous club sports[172] and a variety of recreational and competitive intramural teams.[173] The Outdoor Emory Organization sponsors weekend trips of outdoor activities such as rafting, rock climbing and hiking.[174]
Student organizations[edit]
Hundreds of student clubs and organizations operate on Emory's campus. These include numerous student government, special interest, and service organizations.The Student Government Association (SGA) charters and provides most of the funding for other student groups, and represents students' interests when dealing with the administration.[175] The SGA oversees divisional councils, each coinciding with the undergraduate, graduate and professional schools of the university. Notable among these are the College Council (CC) which handles students concerns primarily for the undergraduate body of the Emory College of Arts and Sciences and annually sponsors the State of Race event, and the BBA Council which does similar activities for the Goizueta Business School BBA Program. The Student Programming Council (SPC) is the school's primary programming organization, responsible for planning five events every year: Homecoming Week, Fall Band Party, Spring Band Party, Swoopstock and Dooley's Week.[176] Emory also has several secret societies—the Paladin Society, the D.V.S. Senior Honor Society, Ducemus, Speculum, and The Order of Ammon.[177] Emory has a partnership with Coca-Cola in which they pledged 3 million dollars over a 5-year period for "Service for Learning" which projects that Emory student volunteers participate to help preserve nature trails, create urban farms, as well as restore neighborhood parks.[178] Emory University also has many Black student organizations, including: the Black Student Alliance, the National Association for the Advacement of Colored People (NAACP), and Voices of Inner Strength Gospel Choir (VOIS).
