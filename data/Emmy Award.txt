An Emmy Award, or simply Emmy, is an American award that recognizes excellence in the television industry, and corresponds to the Oscar (for film), the Tony Award (for theatre), and the Grammy Award (for music).[1]
Because Emmy Awards are given in various sectors of the American television industry, they are presented in different annual ceremonies held throughout the year. The two events that receive the most media coverage are the Primetime Emmy Awards and the Daytime Emmy Awards, which recognize outstanding work in American primetime and daytime entertainment programming, respectively. Other notable Emmy Award ceremonies are those honoring national sports programming, national news and documentary shows, national business and financial reporting, and technological and engineering achievements in television, including the Primetime Engineering Emmy Awards. Regional Emmy Awards are also presented throughout the country at various times through the year, recognizing excellence in local and statewide television. In addition, International Emmys are awarded for excellence in TV programming produced and initially aired outside the United States.
Three related but separate organizations present the Emmy Awards: the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences (ATAS), the National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences (NATAS), and the International Academy of Television Arts and Sciences (IATAS).[2] Each is responsible for administering a particular set of Emmy ceremonies.[3]

History[edit]
The Los Angeles-based Academy of Television Arts & Sciences (ATAS) established the Emmy Award as part of an image-building and public relations opportunity.[3] The first Emmy Awards ceremony took place on January 25, 1949, at the Hollywood Athletic Club, but solely to honor shows produced and aired locally in the Los Angeles area. Shirley Dinsdale has the distinction of receiving the very first Emmy Award for Most Outstanding Television Personality, during that first awards ceremony.[3] The term “Emmy” is a French alteration of the television crew slang term “Immy”, the nickname for an “image orthicon”, a camera tube used in TV production. [4]
In the 1950s, the ATAS expanded the Emmys into a national event, presenting the awards to shows aired nationwide on broadcast television. In 1955, the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences (NATAS) was formed in New York City as a sister organization to serve members on the East Coast, and help to also supervise the Emmys. The NATAS also established regional chapters throughout the United States, with each one developing their own local Emmy awards show for local programming.[3] The ATAS still however maintained its separate regional ceremony honoring local programming in the Los Angeles Area.[5]
Originally there was only one Emmy Awards ceremony held per year to honor shows nationally broadcast in the United States. In 1974, the first Daytime Emmy Awards ceremony was held to specifically honor achievement in national daytime programming. Other area-specific Emmy Awards ceremonies soon followed. Also, the International Emmy Awards, honoring television programs produced and initially aired outside the U.S., was established in the early 1970s.[3] Meanwhile, all Emmys awarded prior to the emergence of these separate, area-specific ceremonies are listed along with the Primetime Emmy Awards in the ATAS' official records.[6]
In 1977, due to various conflicts, the ATAS and the NATAS agreed to split ties. However, they also agreed to share ownership of the Emmy statue and trademark, with each responsible for administering a specific set of award ceremonies.[3] There was an exception regarding the Engineering Awards (those honoring individuals, companies, or to scientific or technical organizations in recognition of significant developments and contributions to the engineering and technological aspects of television): the NATAS continues to administer the Technology & Engineering Emmy Awards, while the ATAS holds the separate Primetime Engineering Emmy Awards.
With the rise of cable television in the 1980s, cable programs first became eligible for the Primetime Emmys in 1988[7] and the Daytime Emmys in 1989.[8] In 2011, the ABC Television Network cancelled the soap operas All My Children and One Life to Live, and sold the two shows' licensing rights to the production company Prospect Park so they could be continued on web television; this prompted NATAS to create a new Daytime Emmys category for the 2013 ceremony to honor such web-only series.[9] The ATAS also began accepting original online-only web television programs in 2013.[10]information is sent to Microsoft.

Digital Rights Management What this feature does
Windows Media Player uses Microsoft Digital Rights Management (DRM) technology to preserve the rights of content owners who want to protect their music or video products. You must have the media usage rights to play, burn, or sync protected content.
If you subscribe to an online music or video subscription service available through Windows Media Player, software installed on your computer by the online store may request to obtain the usage rights before you can play the content. Windows Media Player will automatically scan the protected content for expired rights and request renewals from the rights server.
If you acquire protected content from a music or video store, you may receive the associated usage rights at the same time. If not, when Windows Media Player tries to use a protected file that has rights missing, it will try to acquire the rights for you.
Some protected content may required a DRM software component upgrade before it can play. Windows Media Player will request your consent to download and install updated software. If you decline the upgrade, you will be unable to use content that requires the DRM upgrade. However, you will still be able to use unprotected content and secure content that does not require the upgrade.
Many portable media players contain an internal clock that is used to validate current media usage rights to allow files to play on the device. Windows Media Player can automatically set the clock on your portable media player when it syncs content to the device.
Information collected, processed, or transmitted
Windows Media Player requests rights directly from a rights server on the Internet. The server's web address is specified in the protected content. Most rights servers are operated by companies other than Microsoft. If a DRM component needs to be upgraded to play protected content, the request for the component upgrade is routed to a Microsoft server.
When requesting rights or component upgrades, Windows Media Player will provide the server with standard computer information, an ID for the music or video file, the action you have requested (such as play or burn), information about the DRM components on your computer, such as their revision and security levels, and a unique identifier for your computer. The unique identifier is used only to generate the rights for your computer and, because it is enclosed in an encrypted license request, is not available to the rights server in a way that uniquely identifies you or your computer.
When setting the clock on a portable player, Windows Media Player sends a time inquiry to a WindowsMedia.com server that contains standard computer information, standard troubleshooting data, and a request for the current time.
Use of information
Rights servers provide renewed rights, which Windows Media Player will write into the protected files to allow them to be used. A list of revoked software can be sent to your computer when you acquire media usage rights. DRM software upgrades are provided by the Microsoft servers in the form of a link, which Windows Media Player uses to install the updated software.
Windows Media Player is considered a DRM software component, and thus could be a required upgrade to use some protected content. Revocation does not alter the ability of Windows Media Player to play unprotected content, but you will not be able to play revoked secure content until you update the Player to a more recent and secure version.
Portable players that support Microsoft DRM can be revoked if a security issue is found. If this occurs, your device will be unable to obtain new media usage rights. However, protected content that already plays on your device will still play.
Choice/control
If you chose the Recommended settings the first time you opened Windows Media Player, the Player will automatically try to acquire usage rights silently unless the server requires some input from you, such as registration information or a fee. You can prevent Windows Media Player from scanning the Library for files that need new usage rights by doing the following:
Click Organize, and then click Options.
Click the Privacy tab, clear the Automatically check if protected files need to be refreshed check box, and then click OK.
To prevent Windows Media Player from acquiring rights automatically when you use the file:
Click Organize, and then click Options.
Click the Privacy tab, clear the Download usage rights automatically when I play or sync a file check box, and then click OK.
To configure Windows Media Player to set the clock on a portable media player:
Click Organize, and then click Options.
Click the Privacy tab, select the Set clock on devices automatically check box, and then click OK.
Important information
Microsoft also provides a service that lets you move media usage rights for files that were copy-protected when they were ripped (or copied) to a computer. If you try to play these files on a different computer, Windows Media Player will open your default browser and send a webpage request to a migration server at Microsoft. The request will contain standard computer information, a unique ID for the computer that originally protected this content, plus information that identifies the new computer. Unless the migration limit was reached, new rights will be returned that enable use of the content on the new computer. Microsoft keeps track of the number of migrations granted and allows a limited number of migrations.
For information about revoked playback on devices, contact your device manufacturer.

Windows Media Player updates What this feature does
To give you the latest features and improvements, Windows Media Player will periodically check a Windows Update file on your computer to see if updates are available. If an update is found, you are prompted that an update is available and, if you consent to receive the update, the new software will be downloaded from Microsoft and installed on your computer. If Windows Update is turned off on your computer, you will not be prompted.
Information collected, processed, or transmitted
If Windows Update is turned on, it will transmit the most recent version number of Windows Media Player to your computer.
Use of information
The version number of the Player is used to determine if you should be prompted to update your copy of the Windows Media Player.
Choice/control
To adjust the frequency with which Windows Media Player checks for updates:
Click Organize, click Options, and then click the Player tab.
In the Automatic Updates section at the top of the page, select the frequency you would like to use, and then click OK.

Usage history What this feature does
When you play digital media content in Windows Media Player, some file history and media information is stored on your computer. Windows Media Player also stores information about partnerships with devices that connect to it.
Information collected, processed, or transmitted
Windows Media Player stores usage history information, such as what you play and how often you play it, in your user account information. The Player also stores settings for your devices, such as the names of the devices and sync relationships they have with your user account.
Use of information
Usage history is used to provide frequent and recent lists, generate usage-based playlists, and record your usage of rights-protected tracks. You can view usage history in the following places:
Lists of files or URLs that you have played are displayed in the Jump List off the taskbar on the desktop.
The Open File and Open URL dialogs keep a history of what has been opened.
The Playlist history control keeps track of lists of files that have played in the current session, and the last list from the last session in your user account.
The player uses device information to improve the interaction between devices and the Player.
Choice/control
You can prevent information from being stored if you don't want it to be available to others who use your computer with the same user account. To remove lists of files or URLs you have played:
Click Organize, click Options, and then click the Privacy tab.
To remove existing lists, click Clear History. This also deletes any changes that you have made to the media information for CDs and DVDs.
To prevent lists from being stored in the future, clear the check boxes next to the media types you don't want saved in the History group, and then click OK.

Emmy statuette[edit]
The Emmy statuette, depicting a winged woman holding an atom, was designed by television engineer Louis McManus, who used his wife as the model. The TV Academy rejected a total of forty-seven proposals before settling on McManus' design in 1948. The statuette "has since become the symbol of the TV Academy's goal of supporting and uplifting the art and science of television: The wings represent the muse of art; the atom the electron of science."[11]
When deciding a name for the award, Academy founder Syd Cassyd originally suggested "Ike", the nickname for the television iconoscope tube. However, "Ike" was also the popular nickname of World War II hero and future U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, and the Academy members wanted something unique. Finally, television engineer and the third academy president Harry Lubcke suggested the name "Immy", a term commonly used for the image orthicon tube used in the early cameras.[11] After "Immy" was chosen, it was later feminized to Emmy to match their female statuette.[11]
Each Primetime Emmy statuette weighs six pounds, twelve-and-a-half ounces (3.08 kg), and is made of copper, nickel, silver and gold. The statue stands 15.5 inches (39 cm) tall with a base diameter of 7.5 inches (19 cm) and weight of 88 oz (2.5 kg). The Regional Emmy Award statuette is 11.5 inches (29 cm) tall with a base diameter of 5.5 inches (14 cm) and weight of 48 oz (1.4 kg). Each takes five and a half hours to make and is handled with white gloves to prevent fingerprints. The Regional Emmy Awards are made by Society Awards, a New York-based company that also makes the Golden Globe Awards. The Primetime Emmy statues are manufactured by R.S. Owens & Company based out of Chicago, Illinois which is also charged with manufacturing the Academy Award statues.[12][13]
As its trademark owners, the ATAS and the NATAS hold firm rules on the use of the "Emmy" image as well as its name. For example, the Emmy statuette must always appear facing left. Any copyright notice for the statue should read "ATAS/NATAS", listing both academies. Academy members must also obtain permission to use the statue image or name for promotional uses even though they are winners of the award. Furthermore, DVDs of Emmy-winning shows may reference the fact that they received an Emmy, but cannot use the statue image unless it is capable of being removed from all copies after one year after the award is presented.[14][15]
Area-specific ceremonies[edit]

The Emmys are presented in various area-specific ceremonies held annually throughout the calendar year, ranging from honoring nationally televised shows to regionally and locally produced programs. Each ceremony has its own set of award categories, nominating and voting procedures, and rules regarding voting committees. It is not uncommon for one ceremony to have some of the same category names that other Emmy ceremonies use. (e.g. Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Drama Series and Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series).
A show that enters into one of the national Emmy competitions cannot also be entered into any of the others. For example, syndicated shows whose air times vary between media markets may be eligible for both the Daytime and Primetime Emmys, but cannot enter in both.[16] In general, a show is considered national if it reaches more than 50 percent of U.S. households; programs that do not reach at least 50 percent of the country may enter into the Regional Emmys instead. Web television shows are treated similar to syndicated shows: they must be available for downloading or streaming by more than 50 percent of the US national market to be eligible in one the national Emmy competitions, and they can only enter into one of those national Emmy ceremonies.[17]
Regardless of which area-specific ceremony one wins an Emmy, all winners are called an "Emmy Winner".
Primetime Emmys[edit]
Main articles: Primetime Emmy Award and List of Primetime Emmy Awards ceremonies
For the most recent Primetime Emmys, held in September 2017, see 69th Primetime Emmy Awards and 69th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards.
The Primetime Emmys are presented in recognition of excellence in American primetime television programming. Ceremonies generally are held in mid-September, on the Sunday before the official start of the fall television season, and are currently broadcast in rotation among the ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox networks.
Some award categories presented to behind-the-scenes personnel such as art directors, costume designers, cinematographers, casting directors, and sound editors are awarded at a separate Creative Arts Emmys ceremony held a few days earlier.
The Primetime Emmys are run and voted on by members of the ATAS. For most categories, members from each of the ATAS' branches vote around June to determine the nominees only in their respective categories. All members can however vote for nominations in the best program categories. The final voting to determine the winners is held in August.[18]
Daytime Emmys[edit]
Main article: Daytime Emmy Award
For the most recent Daytime Emmys, held in April 2017, see 44th Daytime Emmy Awards and 44th Daytime Creative Arts Emmy Awards.
The Daytime Emmy Awards, generally held in June, are presented in recognition of excellence in American daytime television programming. The first daytime-themed Emmy Awards were given out at the primetime ceremony in 1972, but the first separate awards show made just for daytime programming was not held until 1974.
Like the Primetime Emmys, a separate Creative Arts Emmy ceremony is also held a few days earlier to honor the behind-the-scenes personnel working in daytime television.
The Daytime Emmys are run and voted on by members of the NATAS. Voting is done by peer judging panels. Any active member of the NATAS, who has national credits for at least two years and within the last five years, is eligible to be a judge. Depending on the category, voting is done using either a ratings score criteria or a preferential scoring system.[19] All the drama acting categories have an addition preliminary voting round called the "pre-nominations", where one or two actors from each show is selected to then move on and be considered for the primary nominations for the awards.[20]
Sports Emmys[edit]
For more details on this topic, see Sports Emmy Award.
The Sports Emmy Awards are presented for excellence in sports programming. The awards ceremony takes place every Spring, usually sometime in the last two weeks in April or the first week in May, and is held on a Monday night in New York City.
Voting is done by peer judging panels. The NATAS solicits anybody with significant experience in national sports production to serve as judges. The panels are organized so that they only have one representative from each corporate entity (i.e. CBS Corporation, Disney, NBCUniversal, 21st Century Fox, Time Warner etc.) Most categories only have a single voting round using preferential scoring system. The top 5 entries in each category are announced as the "nominations", and then the top entry is announced as the Emmy winner later at the awards ceremony.[21]
News and Documentary Emmys[edit]
For more details on this topic, see News & Documentary Emmy Award.
The News & Documentary Emmy Awards are presented for excellence in national news and documentary programming. The awards ceremony takes place every fall.
Voting is done by peer judging panels. The NATAS solicits anybody with significant experience in national news or documentary reporting or production to serve as judges. Most categories have two voting rounds, with separate judging panels in each round. The top entries in each category are announced as the "nominations", and then the top entry is announced as the Emmy winner later at the awards ceremony.[22]
Engineering Emmys[edit]
Main articles: Primetime Engineering Emmy Awards and Technology & Engineering Emmy Award
The Primetime Engineering Emmy Awards presented by the ATAS and the Technology & Engineering Emmy Awards presented by the NATAS are two separate ceremonies that honor individuals, companies, or to scientific or technical organizations in recognition of significant developments and contributions to the engineering and technological aspects of television.[23][24] Generally, the NATAS' Technology & Engineering Emmys ceremony is held in January, while the ATAS' Primetime Engineering Emmys are presented in October.
Each academy has its own separate panel of highly qualified, experienced engineers in the television industry to determine their respective award recipients. Among the ATAS' Engineering Emmy Award repertoire is the Philo T. Farnsworth Corporate Achievement Award, given to honor companies who have significantly affected the state of television and broadcast engineering over a long period of time.
Regional Emmys[edit]
There are 20 total regional chapters located across the United States that each conduct regional awards to recognize excellence in all the regional television markets, including state to state programming as well as local news and locally produced shows. Nineteen of the regional chapters are affiliated with the NATAS,[25] while the Los Angeles-based ATAS acts as the regional chapter serving the Los Angeles area.[5][26]
In general, a show is considered regional if it does not reach more than 50 percent of U.S. households; programs that reach more than 50 percent of the country must enter into one of the national Emmy competitions instead.
The Regional Emmys are essential in helping NATAS and ATAS honor the works of deserving individuals in local TV through a regional outreach. Like the national awards, each region goes through their own rigorous nomination and voting procedures. Committees are formed to review entries for eligibility and high standards. Once accepted, each entry goes before different review committees, and their votes are cast to determine the final nominees. The final votes are then calculated by certified accounting firms within each region. Regardless of winning on a national or regional level, all recipients are "Emmy Award" winners.
Originally, each Regional Emmy Awards ceremony primarily focused on only honoring individuals in local news programming.[3] The regionals have since been expanded to encompass all locally and state to state-produced shows that receive less than fifty percent of the country's viewing audience.

The International Emmy Awards recognizes excellence in TV programming that is produced initially outside the United States. They have been presented annually since 1973 by International Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.[27] The award ceremony generally takes place in November in New York City.
Any non-U.S. organization or individual (i.e. a network, a local or regional television station, producer, director, or writer) may submit a program (unless the show qualifies for the Non-English Language U.S. Primetime Program categories). Organizations or individuals who do not hold copyright ownership of a program must obtain consent from the rights owner before presenting a submission. This process is independent from membership.[28]
College Television Awards[edit]
The College Television Awards are presented in recognition of excellence in college student-produced works. Students nationwide can submit productions and receive recognition in such categories as Comedy, Documentary, Drama, Music, Newscasts, and Series.[29] Entries are first judged by members of the ATAS specializing in each respective field. Winners are then selected by Blue Ribbon Panels.[30] Any work submitted must include a form signed from a faculty advisor to verify that it was produced for a school related group, project, or class.[31]
Other Emmys[edit]
